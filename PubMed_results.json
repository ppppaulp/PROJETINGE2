        "Title": "Burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience among gastroenterology nurses during COVID-19: a cross-sectional study.",
        "Abstract": "To investigate the relationship between burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience of gastroenterology nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the factors associated with these specific variables. A multicentre cross-sectional study with anonymous self-reporting was conducted from 24 November 2021 to 26 December 2021. The study was conducted in Fujian Province, China. The participants were 345 gastroenterology nurses from 7 tertiary hospitals. Burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience were the primary outcome measures. Using a convenience sampling method, the data were collected using Questionnaire Star (a tool for questionnaire surveys) via WeChat. The Chinese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Chinese version of the Emotional Labour Scale and the Chinese version of the Psychological Resilience Scale were used to evaluate burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience, respectively. The total scores for burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience in gastroenterology nurses were 53.07±19.63, 38.79±12.22 and 69.97±22.38, respectively, with less use of deep acting and more use of surface acting. Pearson correlation analysis showed that burn-out was positively correlated with two dimensions of emotional labour; surface acting and emotional expression, and negatively correlated with deep acting. There was a negative correlation between emotional labour and all three dimensions of psychological resilience. Greater adoption of deep acting by nurses can be promoted by improving their psychological resilience during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can help improve emotional labour, thereby reducing burn-out and decreasing turnover rates. Senior management in hospitals must pay attention to nurses' psychological status. Further interventional studies could be conducted in the future to explore relevant measures.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to report and discuss clinical analysis, including the diagnosis and treatment of 4 cases of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) with area postrema syndrome (APS) as the first symptom. Four patients with intractable nausea, vomiting, and confirmed NMOSD were included in the final analysis. All of these patients were initially misdiagnosed and mismanaged. Among the 4 patients, 3 were admitted to the department of gastroenterology at the onset of the disease, and 2 were not correctly diagnosed and treated promptly due to misdiagnosis. Therefore, their symptoms worsened, and they were transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for life support. No obvious early medulla lesions were found in one patient. One patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and plasma exchange, but there was no significant clinical improvement, after which the disease relapsed during the treatment with low-dose rituximab. The clinical manifestations of NMOSD are complex and diverse, and the initial symptoms, onset age of the patient, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings can influence the final diagnosis. Early identification of the APS and timely therapy can prevent visual and physical disabilities, even respiratory failure, coma, and cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is necessary to identify specific and sensitive serum and imaging markers for predicting the prognosis and recurrence of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objectives</b> Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is one of the most practiced procedures in paediatric gastroenterology. As with all other procedures, it is guided and controlled by specific guidelines developed and approved internationally. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines are two of the most followed guidelines in paediatric gastroenterology. This study aimed to determine how optimal patient condition management is when following international paediatric gastroenterology guidelines and to correlate the appropriateness of EGD and other variables with positive or negative findings on EGD. A cross-sectional retrospective cohort of all first-time diagnostic upper endoscopies was conducted between 1 January 2016 and 1 February 2020, in Prince Hamzah Hospital in Jordan. Paediatric patients between 9 months and 14 years of age with indications for EGD. Overall, 529 diagnostic EGDs were performed during the study period. <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-associated gastritis was the most common final diagnosis in 247 patients (47%). Furthermore, 488 (92%) EGDs were deemed appropriate, while 41 (7.7%) were considered inappropriate. Finally, 74.0% of all biopsies performed had positive contributive findings. Abiding by international guidelines in paediatric gastroenterology can optimise care for paediatric patients. General paediatricians are urged to follow guidelines rigorously when referring patients to minimise inappropriate procedures.",

        "Abstract": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in patients with oesophagogastric junction (OGJ) cancer following radical surgery. We aim to conduct a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness and clinical value of additional antireflux surgery (pyloroplasty and fundoplication) for OGJ cancer. We intend to search Medline, Cochrane Library and Embase databases for studies published in English, from database inception to October 2022. Randomised controlled trials and (non-random) controlled clinical trials will be eligible for inclusion. We will search for all eligible studies that have compared proximal gastrectomy plus additional antireflux surgery and proximal gastrectomy alone in patients with resectable OGJ cancer. All potential outcomes related to gastro-oesophageal reflux, including occurrence of reflux symptoms, reflux oesophagitis, reflux occurrence based on barium meal examination, pH of fluid from the lower oesophagus, and 24-hour oesophageal pH test will be assessed as the primary outcomes. Other outcomes, such as patients' survival and postoperative complications (eg, stenosis, infection and leak) will also be analysed. Two reviewers will independently screen the literature, extract data and assess the risk of bias in the included studies; subsequently, a meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan V.5.3 software to pool the results. The χ<sup>2</sup> and I<sup>2</sup> tests will be used for heterogeneity assessment and sources of heterogeneity will be explored using subgroup analysis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation method will be applied to assess the level of evidence. This proposed study is a secondary analysis of previously published data. Therefore, ethics approval is not required. The results will be presented for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and data will be stored in public databases.",

He underwent three exploratory laparotomies and ileostomy for small bowel obstruction and was found to have fluid-filled intestinal dilatation. Serum and stool chemistries suggested sodium secretory diarrhoea. A rapid whole-exome sequencing confirmed de novo guanylate cyclase mutation variant as a cause for his congenital sodium secretory diarrhoea. He required large volume of fluid and electrolyte replacement along with total parenteral nutrition. Several medications to restore normal sodium homeostasis by targeting molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis described in previous literature failed to decrease stool output and electrolyte loss. He was discharged home at 11 months of age on total parenteral nutrition and weekly iron therapy.",

Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) are essential partners in delivering high quality care for pediatric GI disorders, but limited evidence is available to support the role of the RDN in the care of these patients. This position paper outlines the evidence supporting the role of the RDN in the management of chronic pediatric GI issues in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Gaps in the literature, opportunities for future research, and barriers to RDN access are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "A retrospective chart review was completed to examine psychological treatment duration and response among pediatric patients with a disorder of gut-brain interaction including functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was delivered via telehealth with a licensed psychologist or supervised psychology trainee embedded in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Participants were 22 youth (mean age = 14.36 years) who received CBT via telehealth between February and September of 2021, after completing an initial evaluation between February and July of 2021. Patients completed reliable and valid self-report measures of functional disability and pain during treatment. A unique CBT model was employed with an initial focus on psychoeducation and function regardless of level of severity of functional impairment. Consistent with study hypotheses, nonparametric statistical analyses demonstrated statistically significant reductions in functional disability and pain following implementation of the CBT model via telehealth. Contrary to predictions, there was no relation found between severity of functional impairment and duration of treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Characteristics of a cohort of 98 children with medical complexity (CMC) insured by Medicaid were identified within an urban/rural pediatric practice for embedded nurse care coordination. Ninety percent of enrolled children fit the predefined requirements of requiring 3 or more subspecialists for their care. Neurology, orthopedic surgery, endocrinology, and gastroenterology were the most frequent subspecialists engaged in longitudinal care. The expected neurodevelopmental disabilities (cerebral palsy, spina bifida, Down syndrome, and other complex syndromes) were found in 64% of the patients. By applying a secondary definition to include children with complex neurodevelopmental or genetic syndromes, 98% of the patients were considered to be medically complex. The use of reliable and adequate criteria to identify medical complexity is important to determine which patients would most benefit from care coordination services, and our method was deemed successful.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is rising rapidly in many industrialised and affluent areas in the Asia Pacific region. Current available guidelines, mainly from Europe and North America, may not be completely applicable to clinicians caring for children with PIBD in this region due to differences in disease characteristics and regional resources constraints. This position paper is an initiative from the Asian Pan-Pacific Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (APPSPGHAN) with the aim of providing an up-to-date, evidence-based approach to PIBD in the Asia Pacific region, taking into consideration the unique disease characteristics and financial resources available in this region. A group of pediatric gastroenterologists with special interest in PIBD performed an extensive literature search covering epidemiology, disease characteristics and natural history, management and monitoring. Gastrointestinal infections, including tuberculosis, need to be excluded before diagnosing IBD. In some populations in Asia, the Nudix Hydrolase 15 (NUD15) gene is a better predictor of leukopenia induced by azathioprine than thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT). The main considerations in the use of biologics in the Asia Pacific region are high cost, ease of access, and potential infectious risk, especially tuberculosis. Conclusion: This position paper provides a useful guide to clinicians in the medical management of children with PIBD in the Asia Pacific region.",

        "Abstract": "Data are lacking on the immunogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in patients affected by coeliac disease, Whipple's disease and other noncoeliac enteropathies (NCE), characterised by primary or drug-related immunosuppression. We aimed to assess humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these patients compared to controls. Between December 2021 and January 2022, IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies were measured in serum samples of coeliac disease, Whipple's disease and NCE patients attending our gastroenterology outpatient clinic for follow-up, who had received their first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination dose 3-6-9 (±1) months prior. Humoral response was compared with healthy controls (vaccinated healthcare workers undergoing serological screening), matched for gender, age, and time from first vaccine dose at sample collection. A total of 120 patients [107 coeliac disease; 10 Whipple's disease; 2 common-variable immunodeficiency (CVID); 1 idiopathic villous atrophy; 77 F, 42 ± 16 years] and 240 matched controls (154 F, 43 ± 14 years) were enrolled. At 3, 6 and 9 months, humoral response in coeliac patients was not impaired compared to controls. Inadequate humoral response to vaccination was significantly more common among Whipple's disease patients than controls ( P  < 0.001). Patients on immunosuppressive therapy had markedly lower IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres (median 14 vs. 520 BAU/mL, P  < 0.001). As expected, patients with CVID showed no humoral response to vaccination. Humoral immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was not reduced in coeliac disease patients compared to controls, although it was in Whipple's disease and CVID patients. Post-vaccination humoral response should be monitored in patients with Whipple's disease and chronic enteropathies on immunosuppressive therapy in order to schedule vaccine booster doses.",

        "Abstract": "Physicians are prone to burnout which can negatively affect the quality of patient care and lead to medical errors. Burnout can also affect physicians by impacting their personal relationships, their sense of career fulfillment, and job satisfaction. The North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) formed a taskforce to investigate burnout among pediatric gastroenterologists. A 35-item electronic survey was developed to collect demographic and practice information and characterize the well-being of pediatric gastroenterologists. Burnout was assessed employing 2 single-item measures adapted from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The survey was distributed to NASPGHAN members 3 times from February 2020 to March 2020. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and Fisher exact tests were used. One thousand seven hundred ninety-one e-mails were successfully sent and 408 participants (22.7%) returned surveys. A total of 28.8% reported high risk for emotional exhaustion, 17.5% reported high risk for depersonalization, and 33% reported overall burnout. Participants 44 years of age or younger reported significantly more burnout than those 45 years and older ( P = 0.018). Contributors to high burnout identified included increased patient load/demands, insufficient nursing support, electronic health record (EHR) use, insufficient administrative staff, excessive on-call coverage, and more complex patients. Forty-four percent reported not having enough time for their personal life including family. A total of 16.2% of participants reported that they would not choose to be a pediatric gastroenterologist again. Pediatric gastroenterologists are at risk for emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and overall burnout. Strategies to prevent physician burnout should be implemented as soon as feasibly possible to improve individual mental health and patient care.",

        "Abstract": "A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes volunteered to participate in the control group of a clinical study. The study evaluated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with kidney disease. The patient was followed at a gastroenterology department due to Crohn's disease and post-operative bile acid malabsorption. The patient had no symptoms or biochemical findings suggesting liver disease. Surprisingly, a transient elastography (FibroScan®) suggested advanced fibrosis with a median of 16.1 kPa. A liver biopsy showed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-cirrhosis. The diagnosis was only made incidentally and highlights how NASH-cirrhosis may be overlooked due to the lack of symptoms. Clinicians treating high-risk populations, including patients with type 2 diabetes and/or components of the metabolic syndrome, should be aware of the frequently occurring co-existence with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver enzymes may be in the normal range even in people with steatosis, NASH, or even cirrhosis. The diagnosis of NAFLD should include evaluation of hepatic fibrosis as this is the most important prognostic factor for liver-related complications and mortality. Guidelines about systematic screening for NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes are incongruent.",

        "Title": "[Bibliometric analysis on the literature characteristics of animal experiment research with acupuncture and moxibustion].",
        "Abstract": "To compare the diversities in the literature characteristics of animal experiments with acupuncture and moxibustion (acu-moxibustion) published in both Chinese and English, so as to summarize the similarities and differences in the reporting content for the animal experiment research with acu-moxibustion in the journals at home and abroad. The articles of animal experiments with acu-moxibustion published from 2016 to 2018 were searched from CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed, PubMed and Web of Science databases. The articles were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the database was established by importing the essential information, e.g. title, author, journal, impact factor, country, year of publication, citation frequency, funding, disease type, as well as the number of observation indicators and charts. The diversity was initially summarized among this type of articles between China and foreign countries. A total of 7 515 articles of animal experiments with acu-moxibustion were retrieved and 2 458 articles were eligible in compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of them, there were 1 827 articles in Chinese and 631 in English. (1) Among those of Chinese-version, 169 articles (9.25%) were published in <i>Acupuncture Research</i>, listed the first of the article publications. Regarding the impact factor of published journal, <i>Acupuncture Research</i> was ranked the highest (3.187). For those published in English, 78 articles (12.36%) were published in <i>Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</i>, listed the top of the article publications. Gastroenterology occupied the highest in terms of the impact factor (17.373) of published journal. (2) The first authors of Chinese-version articles were all from China, distributing in 461 institutions; of which, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine occupied the top for article publications (142 articles, 7.77%). For the English articles, 16 countries were involved regarding the first authors, and the most of them were from China (523 articles, 82.88%), followed by South Korea, Brazil, the United States and Japan. (3) The frequency of citations of Chinese articles was 7.50, which was significantly higher than that of English ones (4.61). (4) The funding supported Chinese and English articles were 1 680 (91.95%) and 569 (90.17%) respectively. (5) In the aspects of disease name and animal model, 135 and 220 diseases were included in Chinese and English articles respectively. The common top 10 diseases referred to 8 categories, i.e. stroke-related diseases, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, depression, diabetes, spinal cord injury, hypertension and obesity. (6) In terms of the number of indicators, the maximum number was 6 for Chinese-version articles, averagely 2.46, while, it was 12 for English-version ones, 4.02 in average. (7) Among the articles of Chinese-version, the maximum number of charts was 17, and 1 028 articles had 2 to 4 charts, accounting the largest proportion (56.27%). Among those of English-version, the top number of charts was 27, and 347 articles had 4 to 6 charts, occupying the largest proportion (54.99%). The number of Chinese-version articles for acu-moxibustion experiment research is much higher than that of the English ones, the authorship is led by Chinese and most of the researches are supported by funds. There is less difference in the disease types between Chinese and English articles, but the frequency citation of Chinese articles is obviously higher than that of English ones; while, the numbers of observation indicators and charts in English articles are much more than those of Chinese ones. It is suggested that the great attention has been drawn on the acu-moxibustion experiment researches published in Chinese journals, and the reports of the researches are more complete in English journals.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effects of multi-donor fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules combined with thalidomide on hormone-dependent ulcerative colitis (UC). A total of 59 patients with steroid-dependent UC treated at the Gastroenterology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University between January 2017 and January 2019 were enrolled in this study. Using a random number table, the patients were divided into two groups: a group treated with FMT capsules (the FMT group) and a group treated with FMT capsules and thalidomide (the FMT+S group). Multi-donor FMT capsules were prepared, and all subjects and stool donors followed the FMT pathway for FMT transplantation. Each patient's Mayo score, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and level of fecal calprotectin before FMT treatment and at week 1 and week 13 after treatment were recorded. All patients were followed up for 15 weeks. A total of 56.7% of the patients (34/59) achieved a therapeutic response at the end of the research period. Compared with the FMT group, the FMT+S group had better clinical benefit (P < 0.05). In the comparison of efficacy at week 1 and week 13 after treatment, the Mayo scores, calprotectin levels, and CRP indexes in the FMT+S group were better than those in the FMT group (P < 0.05). There were no serious adverse events in the treatment process or during follow-up. A combination of FMT capsules and thalidomide provides a treatment choice for patients with hormone-dependent UC, and it can be used as an adjuvant therapy. However, large-scale, multi-center, and prospective trials are required to further verify the reliability of this treatment.",

        "Title": "Postbiotics: The concept and their use in healthy populations.",
        "Abstract": "The term postbiotic was recently defined by an panel of scientists convened by the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics as \"a <i>preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host.</i>\" This definition focused on the progenitor microbial cell or cell fragments, not just metabolites, proteins or carbohydrates they might produce. Although such microbe-produced constituents may be functional ingredients of the preparation, they are not required to be present in a postbiotic according to this definition. In this context, terms previously used such as paraprobiotics, ghostbiotics, heat-inactivated probiotics, non-viable probiotics, cell fragments or cell lysates, among others, align with the term postbiotics as conceived by this definition. The applications of postbiotics to infant nutrition and pediatric and adult gastroenterology, mainly, are under development. Some applications for skin health are also underway. As postbiotics are composed of inanimate microorganisms, they cannot colonize the host. However, they can in theory modify the composition or functions of the host microbiota, although evidence for this is scarce. Clinical results are promising, but, overall, there is limited evidence for postbiotics in healthy populations. For example, postbiotics have been studied in fermented infant formulas. The regulation of the term postbiotic is still in its infancy, as no government or international agency around the world has yet incorporated this term in their regulation.",

This paper reports two cases of small intestinal lymphangioma in the Department of Gastroenterology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, and makes a comprehensive analysis. A 31-year-old woman went to the hospital with complaints of dizziness, fatigue, and anemia. A 52-year-old woman complained of upper abdominal pain and went to the hospital with abdominal pain awaiting investigation. Both patients were subjected to three major routine examinations, tumor complete set, CT, capsule endoscopy, and deep enteroscopy, and both of them underwent complete resection of the affected intestinal segment. Pathology showed that both patients had small intestinal lymphangioma. The clinical manifestations of small intestinal lymphangioma lack specificity. Capsule endoscopy and deep enteroscopy are helpful for clinical diagnosis, and pathological examination is still the gold standard. Surgical treatment can achieve better results.",

Randomized controlled trials, prospective studies, or systematic review/meta-analyses of adult critical care patients assessing a pharmacotherapeutic intervention and reporting clinical endpoints published between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Candidate articles were organized by clinical domain based on the emerging themes from all studies. A modified Delphi process was applied to obtain consensus on the most impactful publication within each clinical domain based on overall contribution to scientific knowledge and novelty to the literature. The search revealed 830 articles, of which 766 were excluded leaving 64 candidate articles for the Delphi process. These 64 articles were organized by clinical domain including: emergency/neurology, cardiopulmonary, nephrology/fluids, infectious diseases, metabolic, immunomodulation, and nutrition/gastroenterology. Each domain required the a priori defined three Delphi rounds. The resultant most impactful articles from each domain included five randomized controlled trials and two systematic review/meta-analyses. Topics studied included sedation during mechanical ventilation, anticoagulation in COVID-19, extended infusion beta-lactams, interleukin-6 antagonists in COVID-19, balanced crystalloid resuscitation, vitamin C/thiamine/hydrocortisone in sepsis, and promotility agents during enteral feeding. This synoptic review provides a summary and perspective of the most impactful articles relevant to the pharmacotherapy of critically ill adults published in 2021.",

        "Abstract": "As clinical practices change to involve patients more actively and patient feedback becomes integrated into ongoing measures of quality, patients themselves, along with their families and friends, could play a creative part in crafting solutions to improve patient's experience. We could convene focus groups of patients to help examine varied aspects of our practice, ranging from the flow through our offices to the way we communicate. They could work with us, helping us make choices and set priorities. Incorporating both patients' perceptions and suggestions for change can address clinically significant aspects of the patient experience, foster the involvement of patients in their care, and help assess and improve the quality of the care we deliver. The electronic medical record and secure patient portals increasingly provide a powerful opportunity to actively promote patient involvement. Improving of patient's experience can help doctors draw closer to their patients and restore and strengthen public trust. It can both improve the quality of our care and add to the joy of being a doctor. Our purpose is to improve patients' treatment results, and through this, to feel rewarding as a doctor as a professional and to continue working as a doctor. To this end, improving the doctor-patient relationship through improving patient experience can be a key factor.",

        "Abstract": "Medication use may affect imaging results. In this case study, we report a case of lanthanum ingestion resulting in imaging consistent with ingested metallic foreign bodies. Hyperphosphatemia affects most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with morbidity and mortality. Lanthanum carbonate reduces daily phosphate absorption and is indicated as a non-calcium-based phosphate binder in patients with ESRD. A 58-year-old man with a medical history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hyperkalemia and acute respiratory failure after a missed dialysis session. He required vasopressors, intubation, and continuous renal replacement therapy. Admission imaging demonstrated several ingested metallic foreign bodies within the colon. There was consideration of colorectal surgery and gastroenterology consultation. On the initial medication reconciliation, no medications that would have the radiographic appearance of ingested metallic foreign bodies were identified. On further review of prescription data available through the electronic medical record, it was noted that the patient had recently filled a prescription for lanthanum despite its apparent discontinuation on a previous admission. After interviewing the patient's wife, it was confirmed that the patient had continued taking lanthanum and that he was swallowing it whole and not chewing it. No consultations or interventions were performed, and the metallic foreign bodies were no longer present on further imaging after a period of 35 days. Escalation of care was avoided in this patient due to the performance of diligent medication reconciliation and recognition of the impact of lanthanum ingestion on imaging.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate monthly prescription refills for common immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, methotrexate, leflunomide) prescriptions in England during the complete first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary analysis examined unit cost analysis and regional use. A national cohort of community-based, primary care patients who anonymously contribute data to the English Prescribing Dataset, dispensed in the community in England, were included. Descriptive statistics and interrupted time series analysis over 25 months (14 months before, 11 months after first lockdown) were evaluated (January 2019 to January 2021, with March 2020 as the cut-off point). Prescription reimbursement variance in period before the pandemic as compared with after the first lockdown. Fluctuation in monthly medicines use is noted in March 2020: a jump is observed for hydroxychloroquine (Mann-Whitney, SE 14.652, standardised test statistic 1.911, p value=0.059) over the study period. After the first lockdown, medicines use fluctuated, with wide confidence intervals. Unit-cost prices changed substantially: sulfasalazine 33% increase, hydroxychloroquine 98% increase, azathioprine 41% increase, methotrexate 41% increase, leflunomide 20% decrease. London showed the least quantity variance, suggesting more homogeneous prescribing and patient access compared with Midlands and East of England, suggesting that some patients may have received medication over/under requirement, representing potential resource misallocation and a proxy for adherence rates. Changepoint detection revealed four out of the five medicines' use patterns changed with a strong signal only for sulfasalazine in March/April 2020. Findings potentially present lower rates of adherence because of the pandemic, suggesting barriers to care access. Unit price increases are likely to have severe budget impacts in the UK and potentially globally. Timely prescription refills for patients taking immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies are recommended. Healthcare professionals should identify patients on these medicines and assess their prescription-day coverage, with planned actions to flag and follow-up adherence concerns in patients.",

        "Abstract": "A 27-year-old Nepalese male presented with recurrent abdominal pain accompanied by a lower stool consistency over the past 2 years. These episodes occurred several times a year, lasting 1 to 2 weeks, and resolved spontaneously, after adjustment of diet and/or medication for symptomatic control (e.g., antispasmodics, probiotics). Over the last year, the patient had undergone an extensive diagnostic investigation, which revealed no alterations in the laboratory workup, abdominal scan, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and colonoscopy, including biopsies of the duodenum, and colon, so the symptoms have been attributed to irritable bowel syndrome. However, the symptoms had become more frequent, so the patient was referred to our gastroenterology department. We repeated and extended the work-up. Laboratory investigations showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and faecal calprotectin. The remaining laboratory as well an extensive stool workup for infection were unremarkable. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and ileocolonoscopy were normal. Small bowel capsule endoscopy revealed jejunal mucosa with lymphangiectasias, pseudopolypoids formations and superficial longitudinal ulcers, these findings were corroborated by the double-balloon enteroscopy, and biopsies showed marked architectural distortion, chronic inflammatory infiltrate, and an epithelioid granuloma. The clinical, endoscopic, biochemical, and histological findings were consistent with isolated jejunal Crohn's disease. The patient started adalimumab with complete remission after one year. We present this case given its exuberant endoscopic findings and due to the difficulty in making the diagnosis due to its rarity, location, and unspecific presentation.",

        "Abstract": "Outcomes for neonatal intestinal failure (IF) have improved significantly over the past two decades, however, there is no consensus for decision making among UK paediatric subspecialists. The aim was to describe clinician's attitudes to decision making in neonatal IF and examine variation between subspecialties. Neonatologists, paediatric surgeons and gastroenterologists were surveyed electronically. They were asked if they would recommend active or palliative care or allow the parents to decide in several scenarios; or if they considered treatment morally obligatory or impermissible. Of 147 respondents, 81% of gastroenterologists would recommend active care (34.6% regardless of parental decision) for a term infant with total gut Hirschsprung's compared with 46% and 33% of surgeons and neonatologists. No gastroenterologist would recommend palliation while 23% of both neonatologists and surgeons would. Similarly, 77% of surgeons and 73% of neonatologists would recommend palliation for a 28-week infant with IF and bilateral parenchymal haemorrhages compared with 27% of gastroenterologists.Prognostic estimates also varied. A term baby with IF was estimated to have a survival of >80% at 5 years by 58% of gastroenterologists compared with 11.5% and 2.7% of surgeons and neonatologists. Only 11.5% of surgeons and 2.6% of neonatologist believed a 26-week preterm with IF would have a 5-year survival >60% compared with 59% of gastroenterologists. There is substantial variation in views about outcomes and management choices both within and between specialties; with gastroenterologists being consistently more positive. This is likely to lead to unjustified variation in counselling and parental choices.",

        "Abstract": "Causality plays an essential role in multiple scientific disciplines, including the social, behavioral, and biological sciences and portions of statistics and artificial intelligence. Manual-based causality assessment from a large number of free text-based documents is very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes even impractical. Herein, we proposed a general causal inference framework named DeepCausality to empirically estimate the causal factors for suspected endpoints embedded in the free text. The proposed DeepCausality seamlessly incorporates AI-powered language models, named entity recognition and Judea Pearl's Do-calculus, into a general framework for causal inference to fulfill different domain-specific applications. We exemplified the utility of the proposed DeepCausality framework by employing the LiverTox database to estimate idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI)-related causal terms and generate a knowledge-based causal tree for idiosyncratic DILI patient stratification. Consequently, the DeepCausality yielded a prediction performance with an accuracy of 0.92 and an F-score of 0.84 for the DILI prediction. Notably, 90% of causal terms enriched by the DeepCausality were consistent with the clinical causal terms defined by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guideline for evaluating suspected idiosyncratic DILI (iDILI). Furthermore, we observed a high concordance of 0.91 between the iDILI severity scores generated by DeepCausality and domain experts. Altogether, the proposed DeepCausality framework could be a promising solution for causality assessment from free text and is publicly available through https://github.com/XingqiaoWang/https-github.com-XingqiaoWang-DeepCausality-LiverTox.",

        "Abstract": "Physicians need to recognize the potential complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which are rare but can be serious. We describe a case of post-ERCP subcapsular hepatic hematoma (SHH). A 39-year-old man with a history of alcohol use, complicated by chronic pancreatitis and common bile duct (CBD) stricture, presented with right upper quadrant pain two weeks after the placement of a stent for CBD stricture. He was managed with pain control and antibiotics. SHH is a rare complication of ERCP. Hematomas can expand, resulting in significant anemia and liver function test (LFT) elevation, or can become infected. Patients with SHH must be carefully monitored in the post-ERCP setting.",

        "Title": "Predictive Factors for the Prognosis of Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis.",
        "Abstract": "Alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) is a disease with multiple complications and is associated with poor prognosis and significant mortality. Identifying risk factors associated with a poor outcome is important to ensure effective treatment and increase life expectancy. We aimed to evaluate the predictive values of complications regarding mortality in ALC. We retrospectively analyzed 1429 patients with ALC hospitalized between January 2019 and April 2022 at the Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Iasi. The electronic medical records were interrogated to obtain information about demographic data, complications, comorbidities, and prognostic scores: MELD-Na (model for end-stage liver disease-sodium) and CTP (Child−Turcotte−Pugh). Based on uni- and multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 56.15 ± 11.49 years with a ratio of 2:1 in favor of males. There were 296 deaths (20.8%), most of them during the first hospitalization (208/14.6%). It was observed during the univariate analysis that complications of the disease negatively affected the survival rate, significant values being related to infections (sepsis; OR = 21.98; p < 0.001; spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (OR = 11.94; p < 0.001) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) (OR = 9.35; p < 0.001). The independent predictors, confirmed by multivariate analysis, were the association of variceal bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy or ascites, each combination being responsible for two out of 10 of the deaths during the first admission. The prognosis of the disease was negatively influenced by the worsening of liver dysfunction and the appearance of complications. The main predictors of mortality were infections, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Improving compliance and strict application of specific follow-up and treatment strategies could contribute to a better prognosis of patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis.",

        "Title": "Artificial Intelligence in Endoscopic Ultrasound for Pancreatic Cancer: Where Are We Now and What Does the Future Entail?",
        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States (US), the overall 5-year relative survival rate for pancreatic cancer during the 2012-2018 period was 11.5%. However, the cancer stage at diagnosis strongly influences relative survival in these patients. Per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) statistics for 2012-2018, the 5-year relative survival rate for patients with localized disease was 43.9%, while it was 3.1% for patients with distant metastasis. The poor survival rates are primarily due to the late development of clinical signs and symptoms. Hence, early diagnosis is critical in improving treatment outcomes. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained immense popularity in gastroenterology. AI-assisted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) models have been touted as a breakthrough in the early detection of pancreatic cancer. These models may also accurately differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis, which mimics pancreatic cancer on radiological imaging. In this review, we detail the application of AI-assisted EUS models for pancreatic cancer detection. We also highlight the utility of AI-assisted EUS models in differentiating pancreatic cancer from radiological mimickers. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations and future applications of AI technology in EUS for pancreatic cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) symptoms are common (up to 40%) among adults with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), but treatments for this population (DGBI + ARFID) have yet to be evaluated. We aimed to identify initial feasibility, acceptability, and clinical effects of an exposure-based cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for adults with DGBI + ARFID. Patients (N = 14) received CBT as part of routine care in an outpatient gastroenterology clinic. A two-part investigation of the CBT included a retrospective evaluation of patients who were offered a flexible (8-10) session length and an observational prospective study of patients who were offered eight sessions. Feasibility benchmarks were ≥75% completion of sessions, quantitative measures (for treatment completers), and qualitative interviews. Acceptability was assessed with a benchmark of ≥70% patients reporting a posttreatment satisfaction scores ≥3 on 1-4 scale and with posttreatment qualitative interviews. Mixed model analysis explored signals of improvement in clinical outcomes. All feasibility and acceptability benchmarks were achieved (and qualitative feedback revealed high satisfaction with the treatment and outcomes). There were improvements in clinical outcomes across treatment (all p's < .0001) with large effects for ARFID fear (-52%; Hedge's g = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.6, 2.5) and gastrointestinal-specific anxiety (-42%; Hedge's g = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.5, 16). Among those who needed to gain weight (n = 10), 94%-103% of expected weight gain goals were achieved. Initial development and testing of a brief 8-session CBT protocol for DGBI + ARFID showed high feasibility, acceptability, and promising clinical improvements. Findings will inform an NIH Stage 1B randomized control trial. While cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBTs) for ARFID have been created in outpatient feeding and eating disorder clinics, they have yet to be developed and refined for other clinic settings or populations. In line with the recommendations for behavioral treatment development, we conducted a two-part investigation of an exposure-based CBT for a patient population with high rates of ARFID-adults with disorders of gut-brain interaction (also known as functional gastrointestinal disorders). We found patients had high satisfaction with treatment and there were promising improvements for both gastrointestinal and ARFID outcomes. The refined treatment includes eight sessions delivered by a behavioral health care provider and the findings reported in this article will be studied next in an NIH Stage 1B randomized controlled trial.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the largest cause of mortality in patients admitted to any Gastroenterology units. Diagnostic colonoscopy is a valuable tool for the disease's diagnosis and proper treatment but its compliance has been historically low. Our main objective was to find out social, cultural, and psychological barriers among those patients who finally did not show up for their colonoscopy appointment and, make a comparative analysis with those who did. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from October 2021 to March 2022, selecting 224 patients through consecutive sampling. Out of the 224 patients included, males (48.2%) were more likely to show up for the procedure than females (51.8%) (p<0.05). Overall, the most recurring barrier was a lack of knowledge with 116 (51.7%) for both the groups, but especially more for the non-compliant patients (p<0.05). Fear of results, fear of complications of the procedure, and affordability issues stood out as important differences between the compliant and non-compliant patients. For the country's healthcare to be able to overcome these problems, and enter an era where screening colonoscopy is a norm, mass education regarding the issue is imperative.",

Two years after surgery, the patient remained well with no radiological evidence of recurrence.ITPN is a rare pancreatic duct tumour with limited case reports in medical literature. Risk factors are not well established. We report the first case of ITPN occurring in a patient with ulcerative colitis. A typical presentation of this rare tumour is reported to encourage clinicians to consider ITPN in the differential diagnoses of a pancreatic mass.",

        "Abstract": "Visceral pain (VP) is a global problem with complex etiologies and limited therapeutic options. Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C), an intestinal receptor producing cyclic GMP(cGMP), which regulates luminal fluid secretion, has emerged as a therapeutic target for VP. Indeed, FDA-approved GUCY2C agonists ameliorate VP in patients with chronic constipation syndromes, although analgesic mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we revealed that intestinal GUCY2C was selectively enriched in neuropod cells, a type of enteroendocrine cell that synapses with submucosal neurons in mice and humans. GUCY2Chi neuropod cells associated with cocultured dorsal root ganglia neurons and induced hyperexcitability, reducing the rheobase and increasing the resulting number of evoked action potentials. Conversely, the GUCY2C agonist linaclotide eliminated neuronal hyperexcitability produced by GUCY2C-sufficient - but not GUCY2C-deficient - neuropod cells, an effect independent of bulk epithelial cells or extracellular cGMP. Genetic elimination of intestinal GUCY2C amplified nociceptive signaling in VP that was comparable with chemically induced VP but refractory to linaclotide. Importantly, eliminating GUCY2C selectively in neuropod cells also increased nociceptive signaling and VP that was refractory to linaclotide. In the context of loss of GUCY2C hormones in patients with VP, these observations suggest a specific role for neuropod GUCY2C signaling in the pathophysiology and treatment of these pain syndromes.",

        "Abstract": "Previous data support that the inflammatory process underlying ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) can start years before the diagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine if patients with an incidental diagnosis of UC or CD demonstrate an increase in healthcare utilization in the years preceding the symptomatic onset of the disease. We performed a multicenter, retrospective, hospital-based, case-control study. Patients with an incidental diagnosis of UC or CD during the colorectal cancer screening program at 9 hospitals were included. Cases were matched 1:3 and compared separately with two control populations: one including healthy non-IBD subjects adjusted by gender, age, and date, excluding those with visits to Gastroenterology; and a second control cohort of UC/CD patients with symptomatic onset. A total of 124 patients with preclinical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were included (87 UC, 30 CD, 7 IBD unclassified; median age 56 years). Patients with preclinical IBD showed an increase in the number of visits to Primary Care up to 3 and 5 years before diagnosis (aIRR 1.59, 95% CI [1.37-1.86], p = 0.001; aIRR 1.43, 95% CI [1.24-1.67], p = 0.01) and more frequent use of steroids (aOR 2.84, 95% CI [1.21-6.69], p = 0.03; aOR 2.25, 95% CI [1.06-4.79], p = 0.04) compared to matched non-IBD healthy controls, respectively. In contrast, patients with a symptomatic onset visited Primary Care less frequently, but they had an increase in the number of visits to Emergency Department, specialist care, sick-leaves, CT/ultrasound examinations, and use of antibiotics or systemic steroids. There is an increased need for medical assistance and use of systemic steroids during the presymptomatic phase of IBD. These results will help in establishing new tools for early identification of IBD in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Current evidence supports the use of virtual reality (VR) simulation-based training for novice endoscopists. However, there is still a need for a standardized induction programme which ensures sufficient preparation, with knowledge and basic skills, before their approach to patient-based training. We designed a structured progressive programme in upper endoscopy and colonoscopy and aimed to determine its impact on cognitive and technical performance. Prospective, multicentre study, focused on \"Endoscopy I, 2018,\" a course with a theoretical and a hands-on module (20 h) in the GI Mentor II®. Gastroenterology residents of the 1st year were enrolled. A pre-test and test were applied to evaluate the cognitive component, and a pre-training and post-training esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy VR cases were used to evaluate the technical component. The hands-on training included psychomotor exercises (Navigation I, Endobubble I), 4 EGD, and 4 colonoscopy VR cases. The metrics applied for technical skills evaluation were time to reach the second portion of duodenum (D2)/cecum (seconds), efficiency of screening (%), and time the patient was in pain (%). Twenty-three participants were included, majority female (67%), 26 ± 0.7 years old. Comparing the pre-test versus test, the cognitive score significantly improved (11/15 vs. 14/15; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Considering the technical assessment after training: in EGD, the time to D2 was significantly lower (193 vs. 63 s; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and the efficiency of screening significantly better (64 vs. 91%; <i>p</i> < 0.001); in colonoscopy, the time to reach the cecum was significantly lower (599 vs. 294 s; <i>p</i> = 0.001), the time the patient was in pain was significantly lower (27 vs. 10%; <i>p</i> = 0.005), and the efficiency of screening had a tendency towards improvement (50 vs. 68%; <i>p</i> = 0.062). The proposed training curriculum in basic endoscopy for novices is aligned with international recommendations and demonstrated a significant impact on cognitive and technical skills learning achievements.",

Eligible participants were divided into the applet, traditional paper media and control group. We implement a series of tests to evaluate the effectiveness. 20 clinicians and participants using the DFPSSC completed a questionnaire to evaluate the usability. We developed the DFPSSC for an E-learning approach. Of 108 volunteers, 97 completed the DFPSSC learning. No significant pretest differences were found among the three groups (P = 0.303). Applet group had significantly higher posttest scores than pretest scores in intervention (P < 0.001, d = 1.68) and simulation (P = 0.006) test, and it had higher scores than other two group (P < 0.001). 63% participants and 59% clinicians strongly agree or agree to the usability of DFSSC. This preliminary study verified that the DFPSSC can effectively improve participants' knowledge of feces, making it an effective clinical tool for patient education and the avoidance of treatment delay.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past two decades, developments in regenerative medicine in gastroenterology have been greatly enhanced by the application of stem cells, which can self-replicate and differentiate into any somatic cell. The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells has opened remarkable perspectives on tissue regeneration, including their use as a bridge to transplantation or as supportive therapy in patients with organ failure. The improvements in DNA manipulation and gene editing strategies have also allowed to clarify the physiopathology and to correct the phenotype of several monogenic diseases, both in vivo and in vitro. Further progress has been made with the development of three-dimensional cultures, known as organoids, which have demonstrated morphological and functional complexity comparable to that of a miniature organ. Hence, owing to its protean applications and potential benefits, cell and organoid transplantation has become a hot topic for the management of gastrointestinal diseases. In this review, we describe current knowledge on cell therapies in hepatology and pancreatology, providing insight into their future applications in regenerative medicine.",

The patient was examined extensively, during which rheumatology, gastroenterology, nephrology, ophthalmology, laboratory and imaging tests were performed. Due to a rapid progression of renal insufficiency with active urinary sediment, the patient was referred for a renal biopsy, which confirmed tubulointerstitial nephritis, followed by a diagnosis of bilateral anterior uveitis two months later - genetic testing was also conducted, which confirmed the diagnosis of tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome. Steroid treatment brought about a gradual reduction of proteinuria and a stabilisation of renal function.",

        "Abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the leading cause of acute liver failure in high-income countries. Acute cholestasis is one of the most common forms of hepatotoxicity induced by azathioprine. It usually begins during the first year of treatment, with most cases reported during the first month. We describe an uncommon case of DILI that occurred after 22 months of drug administration. A woman in her 50s was hospitalised because of jaundice and asthenia. She had been treated with azathioprine for myasthenia gravis during the last 2 years. Acute cholestatic injury was diagnosed. After ruling out most common causes of cholestasis, azathioprine was withdrawn and subsequent histological findings in liver biopsy were consistent with drug-induced cholestatic liver damage. After discontinuation of azathioprine, biochemical parameters progressively normalised and remarkable clinical improvement was achieved. With this report, we suggest that azathioprine should be considered among the causes of liver injury, despite long treatment duration.",

        "Title": "Recommendations for Optimal Endoscopic Localization of Colorectal Neoplasms: A Delphi Consensus of National Experts.",
        "Abstract": "Colonoscopy is the standard of care for diagnosis and evaluation of colorectal cancers before surgery. However, varied practices and heterogenous documentation affects communication between endoscopists and operating surgeons, hampering surgical planning. This study aimed to develop recommendations for the use of standardized localization and reporting practices for colorectal lesions identified during lower GI endoscopy. A systematic review of existing endoscopy guidelines and thorough narrative review of the overall endoscopy literature were performed to identify existing practices recommended globally. An online Delphi process was used to establish consensus recommendations based on a literature review. Colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists from across Canada who had previously demonstrated leadership in endoscopy, managed large endoscopy programs, produced high-impact publications in the field of endoscopy, or participated in the development of endoscopy guidelines were selected to participate. The primary outcomes measured were colorectal lesion localization and documentation practice recommendations important to planning surgical or advanced endoscopic excisions. A total of 129 of 197 statements achieved consensus after 3 rounds of voting by 23 experts from across Canada. There was more than 90% participation in each round. Recommendations varied according to lesion location in the cecum, colon, or rectum and whether the referral was planned for surgical or advanced endoscopic resection. Recommendations were provided for appropriate documentation, indications, location, and method of tattoo placement, in addition to photograph and real-time 3-dimensional scope configuration device use. Because of a paucity of evidence, recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion. There may be bias, as all representatives were based in Canada. Best practices to optimize endoscopic lesion localization and communication are not addressed in previous guidelines. This consensus involving national experts in colorectal surgery and gastroenterology provides a framework for efficient and effective colorectal lesion localization. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/C71 . ANTECEDENTES:La colonoscopia es el estándar de atención para el diagnóstico y la evaluación de los cánceres colorrectales antes de la cirugía. Sin embargo, las prácticas variadas y la documentación heterogénea afectan la comunicación entre los endoscopistas y los cirujanos operadores, lo que dificulta la planificación quirúrgica.OBJETIVO:Este estudio tuvo como objetivo desarrollar recomendaciones para el uso de prácticas estandarizadas de localización y notificación de lesiones colorrectales identificadas en la endoscopia gastrointestinal inferior.DISEÑO:Se realizó una revisión sistemática de las pautas de endoscopia existentes y una revisión narrativa exhaustiva de la literatura general sobre endoscopia para identificar las prácticas existentes recomendadas a nivel mundial. Se utilizó un proceso Delphi en línea para establecer recomendaciones de consenso basadas en la revisión de la literatura.PARTICIPANTES:Se seleccionaron para participar cirujanos colorrectales y gastroenterólogos de todo Canadá que previamente habían demostrado liderazgo en endoscopia, manejado grandes programas de endoscopia, producido publicaciones de alto impacto en el campo de la endoscopia o que habían participado en el desarrollo de pautas de endoscopia.RESULTADOS:Localización de lesiones colorrectales y recomendaciones prácticas de documentación importantes para planificar escisiones quirúrgicas o endoscópicas avanzadas.RESULTADOS:129 de 197 declaraciones lograron consenso después de tres rondas de votación de 23 expertos de todo Canadá. Hubo >90% de participación en cada ronda. Las recomendaciones variaron según la ubicación de la lesión en el ciego, colon o recto, y si se planificó la derivación para resección quirúrgica o endoscópica avanzada. Se proporcionaron recomendaciones para la documentación adecuada, las indicaciones, la ubicación y el método de colocación del tatuaje, además de la fotografía y el uso del dispositivo de configuración del alcance 3D en tiempo real.LIMITACIONES:Debido a la escasez de evidencia, las recomendaciones se basan principalmente en la opinión de expertos. Puede haber sesgo, ya que los representantes tenían su sede en Canadá.CONCLUSIONES:Las mejores prácticas para optimizar la localización y comunicación de lesiones endoscópicas no se abordan en las guías anteriores. Este consenso que involucra a expertos nacionales en cirugía colorrectal y gastroenterología proporciona un marco para la localización eficiente y efectiva de lesiones colorrectales.

        "Abstract": "To investigate the relationship between laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GERD-Q) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) scale were administered to patients attending the gastroenterology outpatient clinic at the Sixth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital from 7 April 2021 to 10 June 2021. Patients with GERD-Q score >7 were indicated GERD, and patients with RSI >13 were indicated LPRD. The analysis of patients with pure GERD (independent GERD, iG), patients with LPRD and GERD (LPRD & GERD, L&G), patients with simple LPRD (independent LPRD, iL) and the percentage of normal group (GERDQ-negative and RSI-negative, N). 3060 GERD-Q and RSI questionnaires were distributed, and 2974 complete questionnaires were returned. Among them, 274 (9.20%) iL, 334 (11.23%) iG and 151 (5.10%) L&G patients and 2215 (74.48%) N patients. The positive rate of GERD in this sample was 16.31%, of which 31.13% had coexisting LPRD, and the positive rate of LPRD was 14.29%, of which 35.53% had coexisting GERD. Among patients with LPRD, the positive rate of concomitant GERD (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 4.157, <i>p</i> = 0.041) and RSI score (<i>Z</i> = -6.823, <i>p</i> = 0.000) was significantly higher in patients with the presence of respiratory symptoms than in those without respiratory symptoms. LPRD can exist alone or in conjunction with GERD. Patients with both LPRD and GERD had the most severe reflux symptoms. The need to focus on the risk of those initially screened only with GERD developing LPRD. Respiratory symptoms play an important role in reflux disease.",

        "Title": "Failure of Computed Tomography (CT) in Detecting an Aspirin Pharmacobezoar: A Case Report.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Prior studies suggest CT can identify bezoars under certain circumstances. Endoscopy provides diagnostic and therapeutic benefit in the setting of suspected aspirin bezoar. Does the absence of findings on CT scan exclude the presence of an aspirin bezoar? CASE REPORT A 64-year-old woman called the police and stated she ingested a bottle of aspirin to harm herself. Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, she was tachypneic with a GCS of 15. Initial laboratory results were: salicylate level of 1143 mcg/mL, respiratory alkalosis, bicarbonate of 9 meq/L, anion gap of 23, and normal renal function. Initial therapeutic intervention included infusions of glucose and bicarbonate, multiple doses of activated charcoal, intubation, and emergent hemodialysis. After hemodialysis, the salicylate level rebounded, and a Gastroenterology (GI) consultation was requested to rule out bezoar. On day 2, GI requested an abdominal CT scan with Gastrografin in place of endoscopy due to hemodynamic instability. A CT scan was negative for bezoar. After multiple hemodialysis sessions and whole-bowel irrigation with rebounding salicylate levels, GI was consulted again for reevaluation for endoscopy. On day 5, an endoscopy discovered a concretion containing pill fragments. Another endoscopy performed on day 7 removed further fragments. Salicylate levels began to consistently decline. Unfortunately, the patient's neurologic status did not improve, and on day 11 she was switched to palliative care and died. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopy with direct visualization is diagnostic and therapeutic in the setting of a possible bezoar. The absence of pharmacobezoar on imaging should not delay endoscopy in a clinical setting suggesting bezoar.",

        "Abstract": "This study assessed the differences in swabbing rates, vaccine uptake, COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rates and outcomes in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on immunomodulation and patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A population consisting of 250 IBD and 250 IBS patients was randomly selected from the local database. Apart from demographic data, the following data was collected: number of COVID-19 swabs taken, vaccination rates, type of vaccine administered, infection secondary to COVID-19, hospitalization and outcomes. IBD patients performed significantly more swabs tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection compared with IBS patients in both phases of the study. Whilst the IBS cohort recorded a larger number of COVID-19 infection and less hospitalisations whilst infected, IBD patients had a better outcome whilst infected since hospitalisation reason in the latter was not related to COVID-19 infection. IBD patients had a larger uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. This study was the first of its nature locally and internationally as it compared two unrelated cohorts of patients followed up in gastroenterology. Vaccination rates in both cohorts were higher than those reported internationally. In concordance with international studies, IBD patients are not at an increased risk of worse outcomes from COVID-19 infection compared to non-IBD cohorts.",

        "Abstract": "To distinguish clinical features, safety and efficiency of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients after bilioenteric anstomosis based on retrospectively analyzed clinical data and endoscopy procedures. Data extracted from patients after bilioenteric anstomosis due to biliary disease treated with ERCP from January 2005 to December 2021 in the Department of Gastroenterology, Peking University Third Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical data and endoscopic pictures were reevaluated and analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups, including the patients with choledochoduodenostomy (CDD), Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (RYHJ) and Whipple. Differences between ERCP success and failure were conducted. In the study, 89 cases with 132 ERCP procedures were involved, 9-80 years old, median 57 years old, containing 4 CDD, 30 RYHJ, 54 Whipple and 1 bile duct ileocecal anastomosis patients; The time between ERCP and surgery were 30 (1-40), 2.75 (0.5-14), 2 (0.3-19), and 10 years, respectively; The time between surgery and symptom were 240 (3-360), 12 (1-156), 22 (0-216), and 60 months, respectively. Fifty percent of CDD could succeed only under local anaesthesia, RYHJ (96.7%) and Whipple (100.0%) needed under general anaesthesia (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Successful first entry rates of CDD, RYHJ and Whipple were 100.0%, 40.0% and 77.8%, respectively. After changing the endoscopy type, successful entry rate could increase to 43.3% of RYHJ and 83.3% of Whipple. The successful entry rate of different anastomotic methods was significant (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The cannulation success rates of CDD, RYHJ and Whipple were 100.0%, 53.8% and 86.7% respectively, with significant difference between the groups (<i>P</i>=0.031). ERCP success rates of CDD, RYHJ and Whipple were 100.0%, 33.3% and 78.8% respectively, with significant difference between the groups (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Complications were found in 23.9% (21/88) patients, including infection (14.8%), pancreatitis (9.2%), bleeding (3.4%), and perforation (2.3%) ranked by incidence. Causes of ERCP in post bilioenteric anstomosis were anastomotic stenosis (50.0%, benign 39.3%, malignant 10.7%), choledocholithiasis (37.5%) and reflux cholangitis (12.5%). Anastomotic method was the only predicting factor of ERCP success in patients after bilioenteric anstomosis (<i>OR</i>=7, 95%<i>CI</i>: 2.591-18.912, <i>P</i> < 0.001). ERCP in post bilioenteric anstomosis patients with gastrointestinal reconstruction need general anaesthe-sia, with good safety and efficiency. The successful rate of RYHJ was significantly lower than Whipple. Anastomotic method was the only predicting factor of ERCP success.",

        "Abstract": "Next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling facilitates biomarker detection by cell-free DNA (cfDNA) liquid biopsy. However, the efficiency of mutation calling and the prognostic value of cfDNA biomarkers are disputed. We investigated 24 patients with gastric cancer in this study, using a 605-gene sequencing panel to sequence their plasma cfDNA and tumor tissue DNA. The mutation concordance between plasma cfDNA and tumor tissue DNA was 70.6% in stage IV gastric cancer and 30.2% in stage III gastric cancer, indicating insufficient mutation detection rates in stage III and early-stage cancer. When compared with total cfDNA load and blood tumor mutation burden (bTMB), the variant allele frequencies (VAF) of commonly mutated genes are highly accurate in representing disease burden. Further, VAF are a better prognostic indicator compared with serum biomarkers including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The use of cfDNA in molecular profiling of patients allows prediction of patient survival and clinical response, as well as the development of personalized therapy regimens.",

This study evaluated and compared the current status of gastrointestinal endoscopy training programs in all teaching hospitals in the Netherlands from a resident perspective. <b>Materials and methods </b> A national online survey with open and closed questions on gastrointestinal endoscopy training was administered to all gastroenterology residents (N = 180) in the eight educational regions in the Netherlands. <b>Results </b> One hundred residents who had already started endoscopy training were included in the analyses. Sixty-five residents (65 %) were satisfied with their endoscopy training program. Participation in a preclinical endoscopy course was mandatory in seven of eight educational regions. Residents from the region without a mandatory endoscopy training course were significantly less likely to be satisfied with their endoscopy training program (32 %, <i>P</i>  = .011). Criteria used to determine the level of supervision differed greatly between teaching hospitals (e. g. assessed endoscopy competence, predefined period of time or number of procedures). Only 26 residents (26 %) reported uniformity in teaching methods and styles between different supervising gastroenterologists in their teaching hospital. <b>Conclusions </b> Although most gastroenterology residents were satisfied with the endoscopy training program and endoscopy supervision in their teaching hospital, this study identified considerable local and regional variability. Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the trainers' perspective and trainers' behavior during endoscopy training sessions, which might eventually lead to the development of best practices regarding endoscopy training, including standardization of training programs and supervision methods.",

From GI and HPB conditions, cirrhosis predisposed to delirium (OR 2.11 [1.11-4.03], <i>p</i> = 0.023), while acute renal failure (OR 4.45 [1.61-12.26], <i>p</i> = 0.004) and liver disease (OR 2.22 [1.12-4.42], <i>p</i> = 0.023) were precipitators. Total costs were higher in patients with delirium (USD 30003 vs. 10977; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Delirium in GI- and HPB-disease was not associated with higher age <i>per se</i>, but with cognitive and functional impairment. Delirium needs to be considered in younger adults with acute renal failure and/or liver disease. Clinicians should be aware about individual risk profiles, apply preventive and supportive strategies early, which may improve outcomes and lower costs.",

        "Abstract": "Infantile colic (IC) or fussing and crying behavior of unknown cause, affects up to 20% of the infant population and is one of the major reasons for parents to seek medical advice. Therapeutic options are limited and the key component for IC management is parental support. Fennel-based herbal treatments were shown to significantly reduce crying time. The current study was designed to evaluate the parent perception of effectiveness of a fennel-based commercially-available herbal treatment for IC (BabyCalm, Hisunit Ltd., Israel) using a retrospective online survey. This was a real-world observational, case-control retrospective study. Parents of babies with IC symptoms, who either used the herbal product for their baby or did not use any product were invited to participate in an online survey during August-December 2019. The primary outcome was the perceived level of treatment success and symptom improvement. 1218 parents of IC babies (48% females, 90% up to 3 months of age, 58% exclusively breast-fed) responded to the survey of whom 771 used the treatment. Significantly fewer IC-related symptoms were reported by parents who used the product compared to those that did not. Parents perceived the treatment as successful in 65% of the cases, reporting meaningful improvements within 30 min for 69%-79% of the symptoms. The majority of parents perceived the herbal treatment as effective in rapid symptom reduction suggesting that this may provide a satisfactory solution for IC in the community.",

        "Title": "Biomechanical properties of the stomach: A comprehensive comparative analysis of human and porcine gastric tissue.",
        "Abstract": "Stomach-related disorders impose medical challenges and are associated with significant social and economic costs. The field of biomechanics is promising for understanding tissue behavior and for development of medical treatments and surgical interventions. In gastroenterology, animal models are often used when studies on humans are not possible. Often large animal models with similar anatomical characteristics (size and shape) are preferred. However, it is uncertain if stomachs from humans and large animals have similar mechanical properties. The aim of the present study is to characterize and compare hyper- and viscoelastic properties of porcine and human gastric tissue using tension and radial compression tests. Hyperelastic and viscoelastic properties were quantified from quasi-static ramp tests and stress relaxation tests. Tension in two directions and radial compression experiments were done on intact stomach wall samples as well as on separated mucosa and muscularis layer samples from porcine and human fundus, corpus and antrum. Similar hyper- and viscoelastic constitutive models can be used to describe porcine and human gastric tissue. In total, 19 constitutive parameters were compared and results showed significant variations between species. For example, for intact circumferential samples from antrum, the stiffness (a) and relaxation (τ<sub>1</sub>) were greater for human samples than for porcine samples (p < 0.0001). The constitutive parameters were condition-, region- and layer-dependent and no distinct pattern hereof between species was found. This indicates that different parameters must be used to describe the specific situation. The present work provides insight into porcine and human gastric radial compressive and tensile hyper- and viscoelastic properties, strengthening the inter-species relation of the biomechanical properties. Constitutive relations were established that may aid development and translation of diagnostic or therapeutic devices with computational models.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for infections, malignancies, and osteoporosis, related to both the disease state and medical therapy. Identification and treatment of depression and anxiety is crucial for disease management. Guidelines developed by the American College of Gastroenterology include recommendations for preventive health maintenance in patients with IBD to guide quality care. Chart audits in a private gastroenterology practice revealed that only 20% of patients with IBD were receiving recommended health maintenance. The aim was to increase effective preventive care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease by 50% by the end of 8 weeks. The quality improvement project consisted of four rapid Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The interventions implemented for this quality improvement project included a patient questionnaire, an order sheet/order set, a case management log, and team engagement. Providers identified deficiencies and ordered needed health maintenance for 100% of patients with IBD. While effective preventive care orders increased, order completion rates were unchanged during the project. Patient questionnaires, order sheets, a case management log, and teamwork were successfully used by providers in a private gastroenterology practice to increase orders placed for preventive care in patients with IBD. The project tools could easily be modified and implemented in other specialty practices who care for patients with specialized health maintenance needs.",

To observe the effect of lansoprazole and omeprazole combined with antibiotics on gastric juice pH and inflammatory factors in elderly patients with Hp positive gastric ulcer. This study was a prospective observation study. This study was performed in Department of Gastroenterology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. One hundred and ten elder patients with Hp positive gastric ulcer admitted to our hospital from January 2019 to May 2020. The control group was treated with omeprazole combined with antibiotics, and the observation group was treated with lansoprazole combined with antibiotics. The level of gastric juice pH, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70). The changes of gastric juice pH value, IL-1, IL-8, TNF-α and HSP-70 levels before and after treatment were detected in the two groups. The total effective rate, Hp eradication rate, mature type of regenerated mucosal tissue surrounding ulcer and adverse reaction rate were statistically analyzed. The total effective rate and Hp eradication rate in the observation group were higher than those in the control group, while the adverse reaction rate in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P < .05). After treatment, the pH value of gastric juice and HSP-70 in the observation group were higher than those in the control group, while the IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-α were lower than those in the control group (P < .05). The mature type of regenerated mucosal tissue structure around ulcer in the observation group was better than that in the control group (P < .05). The overall effect of lansoprazole combined with antibiotics in the treatment of Hp positive gastric ulcer in the elderly is better than that of omeprazole combined with antibiotics.",

        "Abstract": "To examine the clinical follow up of paediatric coeliac disease and the rate of loss of follow up during childhood, for which data are scarce. In a cohort of coeliac children diagnosed in 2013-2018 in Gothenburg, Sweden, we retrospectively explored the follow-up practice of paediatric coeliac disease until June 2021. We used medical records from hospital-based paediatric gastroenterology and general paediatric outpatient clinics, laboratory records, and questionnaires. Loss of follow up was defined no coeliac disease-related follow up or tissue transglutaminase test over the past 2 years of study enrolment. We included 162 children (58% girls) aged 7.8-18.2 years (average 12.7). Most participants (76%) were followed at general paediatric outpatient clinics rather than hospital-based clinics. After 2.3-8.8 (average 5.3) years since diagnosis, 23 patients (14%; 95% confidence interval, 9%-21%) had been lost to follow up. Patients with loss of follow up were more often boys (61% versus 39%, p = 0.08), with a somewhat longer average disease duration of 5.8 versus 5.2 years (p = 0.11). There were no between-group differences in socio-economic characteristics and patient-reported experience measures of coeliac disease care. One in seven coeliac patients may experience loss of follow up during childhood.",

Blood cultures were positive for <i>Escherichia coli</i> We diagnosed him with pylephlebitis after colonic polypectomy, as a rare complication. He was started on cefmetazole and heparin. Antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy were initiated. He had a complete recovery within 17 days. The patient had no evidence of underlying hypercoagulable condition, and no signs of recurrence at a 3-month follow-up. Pylephlebitis after colonic polypectomy is extremely rare. Although bacteraemia after colonoscopy was a rare complication, phlebitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with persisted fever and abdominal pain after polypectomy.",

We retrospectively analyzed clinical and microbiological data of patients with KP-BSI from January 2010 to December 2019 to identify risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes using multivariate logistic regression analysis. KP-BSI only included monomicrobial BSI and health care-acquired BSI. Among the total 687 isolates of KP-BSI in this study, the rate of CRKP was 39.0% (268/687); this rate in the intensive care unit (ICU) was 65.6% and that in seven high-risk departments (including four ICUs, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology medicine, and hepatobiliary surgery) was 74.6%. The annual rate of CRKP in KP-BSI ranged from 0.0% in 2010 to 54.5% in 2019. The 28-day mortality was 36.2% in patients with CRKP-BSI and 11.7% in those with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKP) BSI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that prior ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] 2.485, P < 0.001), hospital stay ≥ 30 days prior to BSI (OR 1.815, P = 0.007), prior mechanical ventilation (OR 2.020, P = 0.014), prior urinary catheter (OR 1.999, P = 0.003), prior carbapenem use (OR 3.840, P < 0.001), hepatobiliary disease (OR 2.943, P < 0.001), pancreatitis (OR 2.700, P = 0.026), and respiratory disease (OR 2.493, P = 0.009) were risk factors of CRKP-BSI. Patients with a first admission (OR 0.662, P = 0.046) had a lower percentage of CRKP-BSI. The rapidly rising rate of CRKP-BSI in KP with high mortality requires increased attention. Exposure to carbapenems, ICU stay, invasive mechanical ventilation or urinary catheter, prolonged hospital stay, hepatobiliary disease, pancreatitis, and respiratory disease were found to be risk factors for CRKP-BSI. Strict control measures should be implemented to prevent the emergence and spread of CRKP, especially in high-risk departments.",

        "Title": "Effect of home parenteral nutrition in malnourished patients.",
        "Abstract": "The goal of our research was to determine the impact of clinical nutrition in the form of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients with nutritional disorders, most often caused by diseases of the digestive tract, with the risk of developing malnutrition. We retrospectively evaluated 39 patients from the Gastroenterology Clinic and the Home Parenteral Nutrition Center of the University Hospital Bratislava, whose nutritional status was evaluated based on the determination of the body mass index (BMI), the completed nutritional risk screening (NRS) questionnaire and the determination of performance status. Subsequently, after fulfilling the criteria for HPN, the initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) followed, implemented in a domestic environment for the following two years as HPN. During this period, we did a monthly check-up of the objective condition and laboratory parameters of the enrolled patients, which were the basis for adjusting the nutritional treatment. We also evaluated the occurrence of infectious and thrombotic complications clinically and on the basis of laboratory parameters focused on culture and hemocoagulation examination. After two years, we performed control exit examinations, which we compared with the entrance examinations and statistically evaluated the success of the treatment. We evaluated the obtained data using standard statistical methods. During HPN, there was a statistically significant elevation of the individual monitored values ​​(BMI, absolute lymphocytes count, cholesterol, cholinesterase, total proteins, albumins), which clearly proves correctly indicated and managed HPN. We recorded vein thrombosis in v. subclavia and v. jugularis in 6 (15 %) patients. Subsequent catheter extraction was necessary after unsuccessful catheter insertion. In 13 (33 %) patients, tunneled catheter replacement was required due to infection. The mortality rate in our group was 8 % (3 patients). These were female patients aged 39, 42, and 66 years. The cause of death in all of these patients was the underlying diagnosis (oncohematological disease, systemic connective tissue disease, and repeated resections of the digestive tract for inflammatory GIT disease with the development of severe malnutrition). We recorded a positive effect of applied HPN in all three patients until death.We did not register any factors that would have a relevant influence on the success of administered HPN. Based on our results, we can conclude that the patients included in the HPN were correctly indicated, and all of them, based on the monitored parameters (regardless of gender, age, initial diagnosis, or BMI value), benefited from the applied treatment, which was correctly chosen based on their individual needs. Our results clearly document the irreplaceable role of HPN in the management of patients with nutritional intake disorders leading to the development of malnutrition (Tab. 2, Fig. 10, Ref. 44).

        "Abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Global lockdown in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented experience. We report here the results of an anonymous questionnaire-based survey on the healthcare and control of chronic IMIDs (chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases) within the IMMINENT network during the French lockdown (March 17, 2020-May 11, 2020) and the 2-month period following the end of the lockdown (July 11, 2020). <b>Methods:</b> Two anonymous questionnaires were sent by email to 4500 patients who were followed in a university hospital for an IMID in the departments of gastroenterology, rheumatology, dermatology, pneumology, neurology, and internal medicine. <b>Results:</b> A total of 921/4500 (20.46%) responded to the first survey (impact of the lockdown), and 553/4500 (12.28%) to the second (impact at 2-months post-lockdown). Concerning the impact of the lockdown, 420/915 (45.9%) reported affected follow-up. Similarly, after the lockdown, 248/544 (45.6%) declared a negative impact on their follow-up. The repartition by departments of patients' perception of an altered follow-up during (<i>P</i> = .72) and at the end of the lockdown (<i>P</i> = .77) was not statistically different. Our study highlighted the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restriction measures implemented on the self-reported impact felt by patients on the follow-up of their chronic IMIDs without significant differences among all departments. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study is original by showing that patients, whatever the type of IMID, shared this same negative perception. This transdisciplinary study demonstrated the importance of a collaborative network among all departments.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has created a new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunity for colorectal cancer (CRC). Numerous academic and clinical studies have demonstrated that high-level auxiliary diagnosis and treatment systems based on AI technology can significantly improve the readability of medical data, objectively provide a reliable and comprehensive reference for physicians, reduce the experience gap between physicians, and aid physicians in making more accurate diagnosis decisions. In this study, we used bibliometric techniques to visually analyze the literature about AI in the CRC field and summarize the current situation and research hotspots in this field. The relevant literature on AI in the field of CRC research was obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The software CiteSpace was utilized to analyze the number of papers, countries, institutions, authors, journals, cited literature, and keywords of the included literature and generate a visual knowledge map. The present study aims to evaluate the origin, current hotspots, and research trends of AI in CRC using bibliometric analysis. As of March 2022, 64 nations/regions, 230 institutions, 245 journals, and 300 authors had published 562 AI-related articles in the field of CRC. Since 2016, each year has seen an exponential increase. China and the United States were the largest contributors, with the largest number of beneficial research institutions and the closest collaboration relationship. The World Journal of Gastroenterology is this field's most widely published journal. Diagnosis and treatment research, gene and immunology research, intestinal polyp research, tumor grading research, gastrointestinal endoscopy research, and prognosis research comprised the six topics derived from high-frequency keyword cluster analysis. In recent years, field research has been a popular topic of discussion. The results of our bibliometric analysis allow us to comprehend better the current situation and trend of this research field, and the quantitative data indicators can serve as a guide for the research and application of global scholars.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of financial conflicts of interest and quality of evidence in Japanese gastroenterology clinical practice guidelines.",
        "Abstract": "Clinical practice guidelines assist healthcare professionals in providing evidence-based care. However, pharmaceutical companies' financial interests often influence guideline content. This study aimed to elucidate the magnitude of financial ties among Japanese gastroenterology guideline authors and the pharmaceutical industry. Using pharmaceutical company disclosed payment data, we evaluated financial conflicts of interest (COI) among Japanese Society of Gastroenterology guideline authors between 2016 and 2021. Additionally, we assessed the evidence quality supporting guideline recommendations and associations with financial COI. Finally, we evaluated author COI management during guideline development against global standards. Overall, 88.2% (231/262) of guideline authors received a median of $12 968 (interquartile range [IQR]: $1839-$70 374) in payments between 2016 and 2019 for lectures, writings, and consulting. Chairpersons received significantly higher payments (median: $86 444 [IQR: $15 455-$165 679]). Notably, 41 (15.6%) authors had undeclared payments exceeding declaration requirements. Low or very low-quality evidence supported 41.0% of recommendations. There was a negative association between the median 4-year payment per author and the proportion of recommendations based on low-quality evidence (odds ratio: 0.966 [95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.945-0.987], P = 0.002) and positive association with moderate-quality evidence (odds ratio: 1.018 [95% CI: 1.011-1.025], P < 0.001). Still, the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology guideline development process remains less transparent, with insufficient COI policies relative to global standards. There were extensive financial COI between pharmaceutical companies and guideline authors, and more than 40% of recommendations were based on low-quality evidence. More rigorous and transparent COI policies for guideline development adhering to global standards are warranted.",

        "Abstract": "The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction. IBS is still associated with areas of uncertainties, especially regarding the optimal diagnostic work-up and the more appropriate management. Experts from 7 Italian Societies conducted a Delphi consensus with literature summary and voting process on 27 statements. Recommendations and quality of evidence were evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Consensus was defined as >80% agreement and reached for all statements. In terms of diagnosis, the consensus supports a positive diagnostic strategy with a symptom-based approach, including the psychological comorbidities assessment and the exclusion of alarm symptoms, together with the digital rectal examination, full blood count, C-reactive protein, serology for coeliac disease, and fecal calprotectin assessment. Colonoscopy should be recommended in patients with alarm features. Regarding treatment, the consensus strongly supports a dietary approach for patients with IBS, the use of soluble fiber, secretagogues, tricyclic antidepressants, psychologically directed therapies and, only in specific IBS subtypes, rifaximin. A conditional recommendation was achieved for probiotics, polyethylene glycol, antispasmodics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and, only in specific IBS subtypes, 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT4 agonists, bile acid sequestrants.",

        "Abstract": "During COVID-19, restrictions to elective endoscopy were introduced worldwide. A reduction in procedures may impact trainees' endoscopy learning. This study aims to assess Australian advanced gastroenterology and general surgery trainees' self-perceived efficacy and knowledge in endoscopy during the pandemic. All Australian gastroenterology and general surgery trainees in their last 2 years of accredited training were invited to participate through email (2020-2021 and 2021-2022 training cycles). The primary outcome was to assess trainees' self-efficacy and knowledge regarding gastrointestinal endoscopy. Secondary outcomes included subgroup analysis between gastroenterology and general surgery trainees. Self-perceived efficacy was assessed with Likert-scale questions on 20 endoscopy procedures and knowledge was assessed through 21 endoscopy-related multiple choice questions. Eighty-one trainees responded to a self-efficacy questionnaire and 77 responded to the knowledge questionnaire. Over 90% of the trainees were confident or extremely confident in diagnostic endoscopy, but only half demonstrated similar efficacy for therapeutic endoscopy. The efficacy for basic endoscopy procedures was higher for gastroenterology trainees (64.0% <i>vs</i> 51.1%, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Last-year trainee achievement of conjoint committee requirements for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was achieved in 95.8% of gastroenterology trainees <i>versus</i> 22.2% of surgical trainees (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The median score on the knowledge questionnaire was also higher for the gastroenterology subset (90.5% <i>vs</i> 71.4%, <i>P</i> < 0.001). During COVID-19, endoscopy trainees' self-efficacy in endoscopic diagnostic procedures was achieved for most trainees. The differences in self-perceived efficacy and knowledge between gastroenterology and surgical trainees may be reflective of the different opportunities for learning between the two groups.",

        "Abstract": "Up to a third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have elevated liver enzymes (ELE). We evaluated the incidence, predictors, and outcomes associated with ELE in a diverse and vulnerable IBD cohort. We retrospectively evaluated 336 IBD patients receiving care at the San Francisco safety net gastroenterology clinics between June 1996 and December 2019. Baseline characteristics were captured at first visit, then patients were followed until last clinic activity or death. Testing and etiology, pattern of ELE defined as transient (<1 month) or persistent (≥1 month), were assessed. Multivariate modeling evaluated predictors of ELE at baseline, new ELE at follow-up, and pattern of ELE. Baseline median age was 40.3 years, 62% male, 46% White (13% Black, 19% Asian, and 18% Latino), and 59% had ulcerative colitis (UC). Among those without known liver disease (<i>n</i> = 14), 51.6% (166 of 322; 52 at baseline, 114 during follow-up) had ELE. In multivariate logistic regression, 5-aminosalicylic acid use (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-4.4, <i>P</i> = 0.03) and higher body mass index (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, <i>P</i> = 0.01) were associated with baseline ELE. In multivariate Cox regression, UC (<i>vs.</i> Crohn's disease [CD]) had a 34% lower risk of developing new ELE during follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46-0.95, <i>P</i> = 0.02). Mortality rate was higher for patients with ELE (0% normal <i>vs</i> 2.3% transient ELE <i>vs</i> 6.5% persistent ELE, <i>P</i> < 0.001). ELE is prevalent in IBD, especially in CD, and associated with higher rates of mortality. Identification and management of ELE particularly when persistent are important to IBD outcomes.",

During the post-lockdown period to date, EGD, CSPY, EUS, and ERCP increased as compared to the lockdown period (30.6%, 50.6%, 33.6%, and 65.4%, respectively), but only ERCP showed a full recovery when compared with the corresponding period of the year before COVID-19. Endoscopic activity decreased significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown, and only ERCP had a full recovery in the post-lockdown period. The pandemic-related limitations and the backlog of endoscopic procedures represent important reasons for the increased risk or delayed diagnosis of GI cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) or other components of metabolic syndrome are at high risk for disease progression. We proposed an algorithm to identify high-risk NAFLD patients in clinical practice using noninvasive tests (NITs). Evidence about risk stratification of NAFLD using validated NITs was reviewed by a panel of NASH Experts. Using the most recent evidence regarding the performance of NITs and their application in clinical practice were used to develop an easy-to-use algorithm for risk stratification of NAFLD patients seen in primary care, endocrinology and gastroenterology practices. The proposed algorithm uses a three-step process to identify NAFLD patients who are potentially at high risk for adverse outcomes. The first step is to use clinical data to identify most patients who are at risk for having potentially progressive NAFLD (e.g. having T2D or multiple components of metabolic syndrome). The second step is to calculate the FIB-4 score as a NIT that can further risk stratifying individuals who are at low risk for progressive liver disease and can be managed by their primary healthcare providers to manage their cardiometabolic comorbidities. The third step is to use second-line NITs (transient elastography or enhanced liver fibrosis tests) to identify those who at high risk for progressive liver disease and should be considered for specially care by providers with NASH expertise. The use of this simple clinical algorithm can identify and assist in managing patients with NAFLD at high risk for adverse outcomes.",

There, the patient developed complete bowel obstruction and was operated urgently, where intraoperatively, a large tumor in the sigmoid fixated to the lateral abdominal wall was revealed. A subtotal colectomy was performed. Histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen was conducted. The immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CEA, CDX2, and CD20 and negative for CK7, CD10, MUC2, AFP, and PAS staining. Mismatch repair protein testing was negative. The pathological diagnosis was mucinous carcinoma with a clear cell component which bears an extremely low incidence that has been scarcely reported in literature. This stresses the need for more case reports like ours to be published.",

        "Title": "The Evolution of Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A Holistic Investigation of Global Outputs with Bibliometric Analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the main presentations in emergency department admissions. Although there has been much improvement in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment recently, patients with GIB still have high morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to analyze the scientific articles on gastrointestinal bleeding published between 1980 and 2020 using statistical and bibliometric methods. Articles about gastrointestinal bleeding published between 1980 and 2020 were downloaded using the Web of Science data base and analyzed using statistical methods. Network visualization maps were used to identify trending topics. Correlation studies were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Nonlinear regression analysis (exponential model) was used to estimate the number of articles in future years. A total of 12 568 publications about gastrointestinal bleeding were found. Forty percent (n = 5033) of these publications were articles. The top 3 contributing countries to the literature were the United States of America (1646, 32.7%), the United Kingdom (433, 9%), and Germany (391, 7.7%). The top three journals with the most publications were Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (172), American Journal of Gastroenterology (165), and Digestive Diseases and Sciences (161). The effect of countries' gross domestic product levels on article productivity on gastrointestinal bleeding was significant (r = 0. 770, P < .001). In this comprehensive study, a summary of 5033 articles was presented. We think that these detailed analyses will be a quick source to show the past, present, and future of this subject to those who are currently working on gastrointestinal bleeding.",

        "Abstract": "Disease phenotype of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) in children from the Asia-Pacific region differs from that of children from the West. Many parts of Asia are endemic for tuberculosis, making diagnosis and management of pediatric Crohn's disease a challenge. Current available guidelines, mainly from Europe and North America, may not be completely applicable to clinicians caring for children with PIBD in Asia due to differences in disease characteristics and regional resource constraints. This position paper is an initiative from the Asian Pan-Pacific Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (APPSPGHAN) that aims to provide an up-to-date, evidence-based approach to PIBD in the Asia-Pacific region. A group of pediatric gastroenterologists with a special interest in PIBD performed an extensive literature search covering epidemiology, disease characteristics and natural history, management, and monitoring. Attention was paid to publications from the region with special consideration to a resource-limited setting. This current position paper deals with surgical management, disease monitoring, immunization, bone health, and nutritional issues of PIBD in Asia. A special section on differentiating pediatric Crohn's disease from tuberculosis in children is included. This position paper provides a useful guide to clinicians in the surgical management, disease monitoring, and various health issues in children with IBD in Asia-Pacific region.",

        "Abstract": "A 60-year-old woman with a background of frailty, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), presented with worsening shortness of breath and a drop in oxygen saturation on sitting and standing up. Her chest X-ray demonstrated evidence of upper lobe venous diversion. Given the hypoxia, she had a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to rule out a pulmonary embolism. The only finding from the CTPA was pulmonary hypertension in the absence of any clots in the lungs. An ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed portal hypertension with splenomegaly and a cirrhotic liver, therefore, an initial diagnosis of portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome was made.The patient declined an agitated saline contrast echocardiography. Based on frailty she was not deemed to be a suitable candidate for a liver transplant and was discharged with a package of care alongside home oxygen therapy with periodic review in the gastroenterology clinic. She was assessed as stable with no new concerns while on home oxygen and diuretics.This case highlights challenges in diagnosing and managing patients with cirrhosis, portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome with a background of complex comorbidities and frailty.",

        "Abstract": "Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders that affects the physical health and quality of life of many people. Its status as a chronic disease has received continued attention in the field of gastrointestinal research. Bibliometric methods using network analysis were used to identify developments and research trends in functional dyspepsia with a view to informing and orienting further in-depth research on functional dyspepsia. Bibliometric methods were used to analyze the documents on functional dyspepsia published from 2002 to 2022 retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection on 1 July 2022, import literature data into Excel and VOSviewer, and extract relevant information to analyze and visualize the annual number of publications, authors, organizations, countries, journals published, citations, and keywords. A total of 3,532 documents were retrieved, and the abstracts of each remaining documents were read one by one after four duplicate documents were removed, and 2,220 documents were included after screening, with a fluctuating growth trend. Tack J ranked first with 171 documents, followed by Talley NJ (<i>n</i> = 167). The top three organizations in terms of number of publications were Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (<i>n</i> = 131), Mayo Clinic (<i>n</i> = 127), and the University of Newcastle (n = 91).

        "Abstract": "In this editorial we comment on the article published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Gastroenterology</i> [2022; 28 (19): 2123-2136]. We pay attention to how to construct a simpler and more reliable new clinical predictive model to early identify patients at high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to early predict the severity of organ failure from chest computed tomography (CT) findings in SAP patients. As we all know, SAP has a sudden onset, is a rapidly changing condition, and can be complicated with ARDS and even multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and its mortality rate has remained high. At present, there are many clinical scoring systems for AP, including the bedside index for severity in AP, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, Japanese severe score, quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment, <i>etc.</i> However, some of these scoring systems are complex and require multiple and difficult clinical parameters for risk stratification. Although the aforementioned biomarkers are readily available, their ability to predict ARDS varies. Accor-dingly, it is extremely necessary to establish a simple and valuable novel model to predict the development of ARDS in AP. In addition, the extra-pancreatic manifestations of AP patients often involve the chest, among which pleural effusion and pulmonary consolidation are the more common complications. Therefore, by measuring the semi-quantitative indexes of chest CT in AP patients, such as the amount of pleural effusion and the number of lobes involved as pulmonary consolidation, it has important reference value for the early diagnosis of SAP complicated with ARDS and is expected to provide a basis for the early treatment of ARDS.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Diagnosis is based on evaluating specific autoantibodies and histopathologic findings of duodenal biopsy specimens. The only therapy for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease can be complicated by malnutrition, other autoimmune diseases, refractoriness to treatment, and gastrointestinal tumors. This article presents seven cases of malignancies in patients with celiac disease. Its objective is to raise awareness of the malignant complications of celiac disease, leading to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes. Seven cases of malignant complications of celiac disease occurred among 190 patients followed at the Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, University Hospital Brno from 2014 to 2021. We describe these cases and the presentation, diagnostic process, course, management, and outcomes for each, along with proposed potential risk factors of malignant complications. There was one Caucasian man who was 70 years old and six Caucasian women who were 36, 46, 48, 55, 73, and 82 years old in our cohort. Of the seven cases of malignancies in our cohort, four patients were diagnosed with small bowel adenocarcinoma, one with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, one with carcinoma of the tongue, and one with colorectal carcinoma. Malignancies occurred in 3.7% of patients followed up for celiac disease. Awareness of the malignant complications of celiac disease, risk factors, presentation, and disease course could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Crohn’s disease (CD) incidence is rising in India. However, features of newly diagnosed patients with CD in this population are largely unknown. The Indo-Israeli IBD GastroEnterology paRtnership (TiiiGER) aimed to investigate differences in presentation among patients with newly diagnosed CD in India and Israel, and to explore phenotype−serotype correlations. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study of consecutive adults (>18 years) conducted in two large referral centers in India and Israel (2014−2018). Clinical data, an antiglycan serological panel, and 20 CD-associated genetic variants were analyzed. Outcomes: complicated phenotype at diagnosis and early complicated course (hospitalizations/surgeries) within 2 years of diagnosis. Results: We included 260 patients (104, Indian (65.4%, male; age, 37.8); 156 Israeli (49.4%, male; 31.8, age)). Median lag time from symptoms onset to diagnosis was 10.5 (IQR 3−38) vs. 3 (IQR 1−8) months in Indian vs. Israeli patients (p < 0.001). Complicated phenotype at diagnosis was observed in 48% of Indian and 30% of Israeli patients (p = 0.003). Complicated phenotype was associated with higher anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) seropositivity rate among Israeli patients (p < 0.001), but not among Indian patients. Antiglycan serology did not correlate with the tested genetic variants. Early complicated course occurred in 28 (18%) Israeli and 13 (12.5%) Indian patients. The time from diagnosis to complication was comparable (log rank p = 0.152). Antiglycan serology did not correlate with a complicated early course in either cohort. Conclusions: There are significant differences in patients presenting with newly diagnosed CD in India and Israel, including phenotype and distinct biomarkers at diagnosis. These differences suggest different genetic and environmental disease modifiers.",

Cross-sectional multicentric study, using an online survey sent to 31 Portuguese gastroenterology departments. Nine centers were involved, and all departments were engaged in NS activities. The most performed nutrition technique was endoscopic gastrostomy and not all departments had the expertise to perform all nutrition procedures, namely, endoscopic jejunostomy. Two departments had an AN outpatient clinic. Five centers were involved in hospital nutrition committees. Only four performed systematic nutritional evaluation of every patient on admission. Two departments developed research in the nutrition field. An increase staff and nutrition training were pointed out as suggestions to improve NS. This study outlines a broad picture of NS/AN in Portuguese gastroenterology departments. Medical nutritional training and increasing nutrition teams' staff may contribute to developing NS/AN. Multidisciplinary management of nutrition-related disorders is of utmost importance, and gastroenterologists are expected to be at the core of hospital nutrition.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Telemedicine Visits in a Pediatric Gastroenterology Service in the Context of COVID-19.",
        "Abstract": "During the first months of COVID-19, the Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition service of the Hospital Sant Joan de Déu in Barcelona, a leading pediatric center in Spain, introduced a new model of non-face-to-face care. To evaluate the impact of telephone consultations compared to those conducted face-to-face on healthcare utilization. Two main indicators of effectiveness are used: the degree of resolution (percentage of first telemedicine visits that did not generate any new visits in the following 4 and 12 months) and the average number of subsequent visits. A distinction was made between visits for general pathologies (less complex) and those for pathologies treated in monographic consultations (chronic or complex pathologies). Effectiveness at 4 and 12 months was also compared. After 4 months from the first visit, the degree of resolution is lower in the first telemedicine visits than in face-to-face visits for both general pathologies and those of monographic agendas for chronic and complex pathologies. After twelve months, the first general telemedicine visits are less resolute than face-to-face visits, while the resolution rate is the same for chronic and complex pathology visits. Each telemedicine visit generates on average more visits than face-to-face visits. In the short term, 133.4% more in the case of general visits and 51.4% more in the case of chronic and complex visits. In the long term, general telemedicine visits generate 57.31% more visits, while no statistically significant difference is observed between chronic and complex face-to-face and telemedicine visits. The results of this study show that the resolution capacity of the non-face-to-face model in pediatric care in the pandemic context is generally lower and generates more successive visits than the face-to-face model. This lower performance of the telemedicine model should be counterbalanced with its advantages.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> The majority of the money spent on possible new medications' clinical trials is accounted for by the innovative pharmaceutical sector, which also stimulates the economy of a nation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical industry-sponsored clinical trials (ISCTs) in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) towards the national health service (NHS) in terms of avoided costs and leverage effect. <b>Methodology:</b> The research was conducted at National Institute of Gastroenterology, \"Saverio De Bellis\", Castellana Grotte (Apulia, Italy) collecting data from profit ISCTs of pharmaceutical products conducted over the time period 2018-2020 with focus on inflammatory bowel diseases. After the quantification of health services and drug costs from the latter studies, avoided costs and leverage effects were then estimated. <b>Results:</b> The results on the avoided costs for healthcare facilities deriving from the conduct of clinical studies show that, in relation to the sample of five drug companies participating in our 2018-2020 analysis, out of a total of 235,102.46 €, identified as direct investment, 628,158.21 € of avoided costs for the NHS were measured, with an additional saving (leverage effect) for the NHS of 3.67 € for each € invested by the companies promoting clinical trials. <b>Conclusion:</b> Conducting profit clinical trials has practical benefits and a favourable macroeconomic impact that, by completing its limited resources, helps to sustain one country NHS thanks to the avoided costs while also contributing to locational and industrial policy while guaranteeing novel therapeutics and health services for the patients enrolled.",

        "Title": "Integrity of the editing and publishing process is the basis for improving an academic journal's Impact Factor.",
        "Abstract": "Journal Impact Factor™ (JIF) is often used to evaluate the relative reputation and quality of academic journals in their respective fields, and can greatly influence the quality and scope of subsequent manuscript submissions. Therefore, many if not all academic journals are interested in increasing their JIF<i>,</i> to improve their academic impact. To determine the importance of the integrity of the editorial and publication process in improving the academic influence of academic journals and the JIF of academic journals. In this paper, we describe our statistical analysis of bibliometric factors - including the 2021 JIFs released in the <i>Journal Citation Report™</i> 2022, discipline rankings, received and published articles in 2019-2021, and webpage visits and downloads - for seven journals published by Baishideng Publishing Group (Baishideng) and indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded™; ultimately, we introduce and discuss the editing and publishing processes of Baishideng's journals in their entirety, as they form the basis for our objective of safeguarding and bolstering integrity in academic publication. For the seven journals assessed, their 2021 JIFs were basically unchanged from 2020, with the current metric ranging from 5.374 for <i>World Journal of Gastroenterology</i> (<i>WJG</i>) to 1.534 for <i>World Journal of Clinical Cases</i> (<i>WJCC</i>). Further assessments of the journals' bibliometrics from 2019 to 2020, showed that <i>World Journal of Stem Cells</i> has the highest self-citation rate (1.43%) and <i>World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery</i> has the lowest (0.21%). Additionally, the total 3012 articles published during this period were cited by more than 20000 articles in approximately 8000 academic journals. Of note, the 1102 articles published in <i>WJG</i> were cited by articles in 3059 journals, among which 171 journals have a JIF of > 10, including internationally renowned academic journals such as <i>CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians</i> (2021 JIF 286.130, record count: 1)<i>, Lancet</i> (2021 JIF 202.731, record count: 4)<i>, Nature Reviews Immunology</i> (2021 JIF 108.555, record count: 2), <i>Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology</i> (2021 JIF 73.082, record count: 9), <i>Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology</i> (2021 JIF 45.042, record count: 8), <i>Gastroenterology</i> (2021 JIF 33.883, record count: 19), and <i>Gut</i> (2021 JIF 31.793, record count: 21). This suggests that Baishideng's journals have been widely recognized for their academic quality. In the <i>Reference Citation Analysis</i> (<i>RCA</i>) database, all seven Baishideng-published journals obtained a 2022 <i>Journal Article Influence Index</i> (<i>JAII</i>). For example, <i>WJG</i> has a 2022 <i>JAII</i> of 22.048, ranking 18<sup>th</sup> out of 102 journals in the field of gastroenterology & hepatology in the <i>RCA</i>, with 469909 total citations (6/102) and 21313 total articles (5/102). The numbers of manuscripts received and published in 2021 were both higher than those in 2019-2020. For example, <i>WJCC</i> received a total of 3650 manuscripts in 2021, which is 91.1% higher than those in 2019-2020 (average: 1910 papers/year). In 2021, <i>WJCC</i> published 1296 articles, representing an increase of 105.1% compared to those in 2019-2020 (average: 632 articles/year). The numbers of webpage visits and downloads received by the seven journals have increased year by year. For example, the number of total visits received by <i>WJG</i> in 2019-2021 was 1974052 in 2019, 2317835 in 2020 (increased by 17.4% compared with that in 2019), and 2652555 in 2021 (increased by 4.4% compared with that in 2020). The visitors were from more than 220 countries and regions worldwide, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Open access (OA) plays a vital role in improving the quality, efficiency, transparency, and integrity of academic journal publishing. From 2019 to 2021, a total of 5543 OA articles were published in the seven journals, of which 2083 (37.6%) were invited and published free-of-charge. During the same period, 1683 articles were published in <i>WJG</i>, and the authors were from more than 70 countries and regions. For the total 5543 articles published in the seven journals from 2019 to 2021, 3903 article quality tracking reports were received after the online publication of these articles. The quality of the articles was further evaluated through the Baishideng's article quality and author evaluation tracking system, with 4655 articles (84.0%) having received author evaluation and feedback, which contributes to tracking metrics for authors' satisfaction with the collective publication processes. From March 25, 2021 to June 28, 2022, the seven journals received a total of 424 reader evaluations and 229 letters from readers; this subsequent reader engagement demonstrates that the popularity of the published articles and the volume of their readership audience were improved through the reader evaluation system. Ultimately, the findings from our bibliometric assessments indicate that establishing, promoting and actively practicing processes that safeguard and bolster the integrity of the editing and publication process also help to improve the academic influence of academic journals, which itself is the cornerstone for improving JIF.",

        "Title": "Minor hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with portal hypertension: A case report and review of the literature.",
        "Abstract": "Curative modalities for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include liver resection (LR) and transplantation. For patients with portal hypertension (PH), liver transplantation (LT) is the preferred treatment but is oftentimes limited by organ shortage and can lead candidates to drop off due to disease progression, while hepatectomy has a higher risk of complications. This would pose a dilemma as to whether wait for donor organs or prioritize hepatectomy. The patient was a 56-year-old male, a case of liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C with sustained virological response following direct-acting antiviral agents. He was a liver transplant candidate, presented to the gastroenterology outpatient department for a recently-diagnosed liver tumor during a regular follow-up session. Pre-operative survey revealed PH manifested by thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, huge splenorenal shunt and varices. The patient's Child-Pugh score was 7. Considering the patient's overall condition, tumor size and location, and a shortage of grafts, he underwent segment 5 and 6 partial hepatectomy. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated HCC. His postoperative course was complicated by refractory intraabdominal infection (IAI) and recovered under aggressive antibiotics treatment. He remained recurrence-free for over a year. For patients with early resectable HCC, the approach of having a minor hepatectomy followed by salvage transplantation should serve as a compromising strategy. Tumor resection retards the progression of the disease. Comprehensive healthcare can expectantly improve clinical outcomes.",

        "Title": "Correlation of Clinically-Suspected Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) With Laboratory-Confirmed SBP in Portosystemic Encephalopathy Patients.",
        "Abstract": "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is among the most common complications of liver cirrhosis with ascites. In the past, it was considered a potentially incurable disease, but its prognosis, though still quite poor, has much improved in the past few years. This has become possible due to early diagnosis and prompt treatment of this once-incurable complication of ascites. The main aim of this study was to know the relation between clinically suspected SBP and laboratory-confirmed SBP so that in the absence or delay in the more accurate diagnostic facilities, clinicians can start the treatment promptly based on diagnostically significant clinical findings while awaiting the most accurate diagnostic tests. This study was done at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar. After ethical approval, 186 patients with classical features of SBP i.e., fever and abdominal pain and/or tenderness (clinically SBP patients), and 104 patients without these features (clinically non-SBP patients) were studied for ascitic fluid neutrophils count, as a diagnostic test for SBP. Out of 186 patients with clinically suspected SBP, 171 (91.9%) patients had laboratory-confirmed SBP and 15 (8.1%) had no SBP. Among 104 clinically non-SBP patients, 90 (86.5%) had laboratory-confirmed non-SBP, while 14 (13.5%) had SBP in laboratory studies. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the clinical features in diagnosing SBP were 92%, 86%, 92%, and 87% respectively.  Conclusion: Clinical features diagnostic for SBP can play a vital role in early diagnosis and hence requires prompt treatment in circumstances where diagnostic laboratory tests are not available and/or are delayed.",

        "Abstract": "Consequences of physician burnout include medical errors, higher rate of staff turnover, and decreased patient satisfaction. We examined the prevalence of burnout and identified the contributing factors in gastroenterologists and fellows in training. We performed 3 separate surveys through the American College of Gastroenterology. (1) A national survey of practicing gastroenterologists in the United States that measured burnout and contributing factors, (2) a survey of gastroenterology fellows in training to determine self-identified burnout, as well as mitigating and exacerbating factors, and (3) a follow-up survey of fellows during the COVID-19 pandemic. One thousand and twenty-one persons responded (9.2% response rate) to the first survey, including 756 individuals who completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory survey. Overall, the prevalence of high burnout was 49.3%. Factors associated with high burnout included female sex, younger age, shorter duration in practice, considering the electronic health record non-user-friendly, 2 or more hours of patient-related work at home per day, 8 or more hours of outpatient time per day, 6 or more inpatient consults per day, taking call with procedures 10 or more times per year, and having children at home. With regard to lifestyle factors, taking 20 days or more of vacation time was associated with a lower rate of burnout. The level of burnout for fellows was observed to be high (42.7% in survey 2 and 35.3% in survey 3). Burnout is high in gastroenterologists and fellows in training. Specific contributing factors were both systems based and personal and provide insight into changes that can be made to address burnout.",

        "Title": "Increased CHCHD2 expression promotes liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis via Notch/osteopontin signaling.",
        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is closely related to liver fibrosis. The role of coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing 2 (CHCHD2) in NASH remains unknown. CHCHD2's functions as a transcription factor have received much less attention than those in mitochondria. Herein, we systematically characterized the role of CHCHD2 as a transcription factor by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and found its target genes were enriched in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Overall, CHCHD2 expression was found to be increased in the livers of patients with NAFLD and those of NASH mice. In line with these findings, CHCHD2 deficiency ameliorated NASH- and thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis, whereas hepatocyte-specific CHCHD2 overexpression promoted liver fibrosis in NASH mice via Notch signaling. Specifically, CHCHD2-overexpressing hepatocytes activated hepatic stellate cells by upregulating osteopontin levels, a downstream mediator of Notch signals. Moreover, Notch inhibition attenuated CHCHD2 overexpression-induced liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Then we found lipopolysaccharide-induced CHCHD2 expression in hepatocytes was reverted by verteporfin, an inhibitor that disrupts the interaction between Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional enhanced associate domains (TEADs). In addition, CHCHD2 levels were positively correlated with those of TEAD1 in human samples. In conclusion, CHCHD2 is upregulated via YAP/TAZ-TEAD in NASH livers and consequently promotes liver fibrosis by activating the Notch pathway and enhancing osteopontin production.",

        "Abstract": "The study aimed to determine the impact of exercise duration on gastrointestinal functional responses and gastrointestinal symptoms (GISs) in response to differing exercise durations. Endurance runners (<i>n</i> = 16) completed three trials on separate occasions, randomized to 1 h (1-H), 2 h (2-H), and 3 h (3-H) of running at 60% V̇o<sub>2max</sub> in temperate ambient temperature. Orocecal transit time (OCTT) was determined by lactulose challenge, with concomitant breath hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) determination. Gastric slow wave activity was recorded using cutaneous electrogastrography (cEGG) before and after exertion. GIS was determined using a modified visual analog scale (mVAS). OCTT response was classified as very slow on all trials (∼93-101 min) with no trial difference observed (<i>P</i> = 0.895). Bradygastria increased postexercise on all trials (means ± SD: 1-H: 10.9 ± 11.7%, 2-H: 6.2 ± 9.8%, and 3-H: 13.2 ± 21.4%; <i>P</i> < 0.05). A reduction in the normal gastric slow wave activity (2-4 cycles/min) was observed postexercise on 1-H only (-10.8 ± 17.6%; <i>P</i> = 0.039). GIS incidence and gut discomfort was higher on 2-H (81% and 12 counts) and 3-H (81% and 18 counts), compared with 1-H (69% and 6 counts) (<i>P</i> = 0.038 and <i>P</i> = 0.006, respectively). Severity of gut discomfort, total-GIS, upper-GIS, and lower-GIS increased during exercise on all trials (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Steady-state exercise in temperate ambient conditions for 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h instigates perturbations in gastric slow wave activity compared with rest and hampers OCTT, potentially explaining the incidence and severity on exercise-associated GIS.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Exercise stress per se appears to instigate perturbations to gastric myoelectrical activity, resulting in an increase in bradygastria frequency, inferring a reduction in gastric motility. The perturbations to gastrointestinal functional responses instigated by exercise per se, likely contribute to the high incidence and severity level of exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Cutaneous electrogastrography is not commonly used in exercise gastroenterology research, however, may be a useful aid in providing an overall depiction of gastrointestinal function. Particularly relating to gastrointestinal motility and concerning gastroparesis.",

        "Abstract": "As yet, there is no unified method of treatment for the evaluation and management of gastric low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) worldwide. Patients with gastric LGIN who had been treated with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication were gathered retrospectively. Based on several relevant characteristics described and analyzed by LASSO regression analysis and multivariable logistic regression, a prediction nomogram model was established. C-index, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were adopted to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the model. A total of 309 patients with LGIN were randomly divided into the training groups and the validation groups. LASSO regression analysis and multivariable logistic regression identified that 6 variables including gender, size, location, borderline, number, and erosion were independent risk factors. The nomogram model displayed good discrimination with a C-index of .765 (95% confidence interval: .702-.828). The accuracy and reliability of the model were also verified by an AUC of .764 in the training group and .757 in the validation group. Meanwhile, the calibration curve and the DCA suggested that the predictive nomogram had promising accuracy and clinical utility. A predictive nomogram model was constructed and proved to be clinically applicable to identify high-risk groups with possible pathologic upgrade in patients with gastric LGIN. Since it is regarded that strengthening follow-up or endoscopic treatment of high-risk patients may contribute to improving the detection rate or reducing the incidence of gastric cancer, the predictive nomogram model provides a reliable basis for the treatment of LGIN.",

        "Title": "The etiological spectrum of bowel obstruction and early postoperative outcome among neonates at a tertiary hospital in Uganda.",
        "Abstract": "Bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency in newborns. One-fourth of neonates with obstruction suffer postoperative complications, with high mortality, especially in low-income countries. Factors attributed to mortality include prematurity, late presentation and associated multiple congenital anomalies. The prevalence and the predictors of mortality in our setting have not been well studied. We aimed to describe the early postoperative outcomes and to determine the predictors of mortality among neonates with bowel obstruction. We conducted a prospective cohort study during 4 months, when we recruited postoperative neonates from the pediatric surgery unit of Mulago Hospital. We collected data on demographics, clinical presentations, maternal characteristics, the surgical procedure performed, postoperative outcomes, etc. After follow-up for 2 weeks, we analyzed the data using Cox proportional hazards regression models of predictors of mortality. A total of 76 neonates were recruited, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.2:1. The age ranged from 1 to 26 days, a median of 3 [interquartile range (IQR): 2, 7]. About 67.1% had birth weights ranging between 2.5 kg and 3.5 kg, a mean of 2.8 [standard deviation(SD)=0.64]; 76.3% were termed; with anorectal malformation (ARM), 31.6% as the leading cause, followed by jejunoileal atresia (JIA), 25%. Nearly 55.3% of neonates developed complications; 53.9% with post-operative fever, 15.8% had wound sepsis. The mortality rate was 44.7% (34/76) and was highest among cases of JIA, 41.2%. The predictors of mortality included prematurity, fever at admission, breastfeeding status, and mother's parity as well as the cadre of healthcare providers (p<0.005). ARM is the predominant cause of bowel obstruction among neonates, followed by JIA. The morbidity and mortality due to bowel obstruction among neonates are unacceptably high. The major predictors of mortality were prematurity, fever at admission, and the cadre of the healthcare providers.",

        "Title": "Development and evaluation of a patient decision aid for pediatric interval appendectomy.",
        "Abstract": "One option for the treatment of perforated appendicitis in pediatric patients is interval appendectomy (IA). A patient decision aid (PDA) can be useful in the decision-making process regarding IA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate parents' decisional conflict before and after engaging with a developed PDA. Participants included (a) parents who are considering IA surgery for their child, (b) have not yet had their follow-up appointment postdischarge, and (c) were fluent in either the official languages of English or French. This study used a pretest and post-test design to measure participants' decisional conflict and treatment option choice. Perceptions and acceptability of the PDA were also assessed. A total of 18 participants completed the study (16 mothers). Major findings include significant decreases in all Decisional Conflict Scale items from pre-PDA to post-PDA engagement, except for one item. The majority of participants perceived the PDA to be useful, easy to find information regarding risks and provided enough information to help them make a decision regarding their child's treatment. This is the first study to develop and evaluate a PDA among parents who are making a decision regarding IA surgery. The results showed a significant decrease in decisional conflict after using the PDA. The results also showed that the PDA was generally accepted among parents and had positive perceptions regarding length, content, and balance. The use of PDA for this population can help ease feelings of decisional conflict and equip parents with the information to make informed decisions.",

        "Abstract": "No systematic review and meta-analysis to date has examined multiple child and parent-reported social and physical quality of life (QoL) in pediatric populations affected by Hirschsprung's disease (HD) and anorectal malformations (ARM). The objective of this systematic review is to quantitatively summarize the parent-reported and child-reported psychosocial and physical functioning scores of such children. Records were sourced from the CENTRAL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases. Studies that reported child and parent reported QoL in children with HD and ARM, regardless of surgery intervention, versus children without HD and ARM, were included. The primary outcome was the psychosocial functioning scores, and the secondary outcomes were the presence of postoperative constipation, postoperative obstruction symptoms, fecal incontinence, and enterocolitis. A random effects meta-analysis was used. Twenty-three studies were included in the systematic review, with 11 studies included in the meta-analysis. Totally, 1678 total pediatric patients with HD and ARM underwent surgery vs 392 healthy controls. Pooled parent-reported standardized mean (SM) scores showed better social functioning after surgery (SM 91.79, 95% CI (80.3 to 103.3), I<sup>2</sup>=0). The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) showed evidence for parent-reported incontinence but not for constipation in children with HD and ARM after surgery that had a lower mean QoL score compared with the normal population (SMD -1.24 (-1.79 to -0.69), I<sup>2</sup>=76% and SMD -0.45, 95% CI (-1.12 to 0.21), I<sup>2</sup>=75%). The pooled prevalence of child-reported constipation was 22% (95% CI (16% to 28%), I<sup>2</sup>=0%). The pooled prevalence of parent-reported postoperative obstruction symptoms was 61% (95% CI (41% to 81%), I<sup>2</sup>=41%). The results demonstrate better social functioning after surgery, lower QoL scores for incontinence versus controls, and remaining constipation and postoperative obstruction symptoms after surgery in children with HD and ARM.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have suggested an association between vascular endothelial growth factor A (<i>VEGFA</i>) rs3025039 polymorphism and biliary atresia (BA). However, this conclusion is controversial and there is no published pooled evidence of this association. This study was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). A thorough search was performed on databases including PubMed, Embase, and Chinese Biomedical Database up to August 2020. This study included 846 cases of BA and 2821 controls concerning <i>VEGFA</i> rs3025039 polymorphism. We selected relevant studies based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) the study design was case-control and cohort and (2) the patients carried standard clinical diagnoses of BA, etc. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with other related diseases, (2) lack of requisite information and (3) duplicate data. The OR (odd ratio) and the corresponding 95% CI (confidence interval) were calculated to estimate the association. This study on <i>VEGFA</i> rs3025039 polymorphism in the Chinese population included 846 cases and 2821 controls. The results showed that there was no significant association between rs3025039 and susceptibility to BA under four genetic models. The results of the subgroup analysis were similar to the overall results. This meta-analysis shows that rs3025039 was not associated with susceptibility to BA in the Chinese population. Further validation may entail additional research. CRD42020203812.",

        "Title": "Expression and possible role of Smad3 in postnecrotizing enterocolitis stricture.",
        "Abstract": "To investigate the expression of Smad3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3) protein in postnecrotizing enterocolitis stricture and its possible mechanism of action. We used immunohistochemistry to detect the expression characteristics of Smad3 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) proteins in human postnecrotizing enterocolitis stricture. We cultured IEC-6 (crypt epithelial cells of rat small intestine) in vitro and inhibited the expression of Smad3 using siRNA technique. Quantitative PCR, western blotting, and ELISA were used to detect the changes in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), NF-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions in IEC-6 cells. CCK8 kit and Transwell cellular migration were used to detect cell proliferation and migration. Changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin and vimentin) in IEC-6 cells were detected by immunofluorescence technique. The results showed that Smad3 protein and NF-κB protein were overexpressed in narrow intestinal tissues and that Smad3 protein expression was positively correlated with NF-κB protein expression. After inhibiting the expression of Smad3 in IEC-6 cells, the mRNA expressions of NF-κB, TGF-β1, ZO-1, and VEGF decreased, whereas the mRNA expression of TNF-α did not significantly change. TGF-β1, NF-κB, and TNF-α protein expressions in IEC-6 cells decreased, whereas ZO-1 and intracellular VEGF protein expressions increased. IEC-6 cell proliferation and migration capacity decreased. There was no significant change in protein expression levels of EMT markers E-cadherin and vimentin and also extracellular VEGF protein expression. We suspect that the high expression of Smad3 protein in postnecrotizing enterocolitis stricture may promote the occurrence and development of secondary intestinal stenosis. The mechanism may be related to the regulation of TGF-β1, NF-κB, TNF-α, ZO-1, and VEGF mRNA and protein expression. This may also be related to the ability of Smad3 to promote epithelial cell proliferation and migration.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, no generally accepted curriculum for operating room nurses (OR nurses) working with robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) exists. OR nurses working with RAS require different competencies than regular OR nurses, e.g. knowledge of the robotic system and equipment and specific emergency undocking procedures. The objective of this study was to identify learning goals for a curriculum for OR nurses working with RAS and to investigate which learning methods should be used. A three-round Delphi approach, with an additional survey, was used in this study. Four OR nurses from every department in gynecology, urology, and surgical gastroenterology doing RAS in Denmark were invited to participate. The response rates were 93%, 81%, and 79%, respectively, in the three rounds of the Delphi survey and 68% in the additional survey. After the processing of data, a list of 57 learning goals, sorted under 11 domains, was produced. 41 learning goals were rated Relevant, Very relevant, or Essential spread over 10 of the 11 domains. The top 3 learning goals rated as Essential: Identify the most common injuries related to patient positioning during robotic-assisted surgery and know how to avoid them, Connect, calibrate and handle the scope, Perform an emergency undocking procedure. The panel rated Supervised training during surgery on patients as the most relevant learning method, followed by Dry lab and Team training. The learning goals identified in this study, can be used as the basis for a curriculum for OR nurses working with RAS. During the processing, it became clear that there is a need to further investigate issues such as communication challenges, awareness of emergency procedures, and differences in the skills required depending on the role of the RAS nurse.",

However, there is a scarcity of real-life experience with the use of these stents exclusively in EC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SEMS in inoperable ECs in the western region of Saudi Arabia. A retrospective review of SEMS placed in a tertiary referral hospital for histologically proven inoperable EC from 2016 to 2019. Demographics data, procedure success, complication, re-intervention, and mortality were analyzed. Forty-eight SEMS placed in 35 patients for palliation of dysphagia. The median age of patients was 68 years (range 31-95). 69% (24) patients have a lower third of EC and the rest have a middle third. SEMSs were placed successfully in all cases with symptomatic improvement. No major stent-related complication was seen. 28% (13) patients required re-intervention with additional SEMS placement, nine of which were for tissue in growth and four for distal migration. Median survival was 114 days (range 30-498). Most of the complications seen in fully covered SEMS compared to the partially covered 50% (8/16) vs 17% (5/30), respectively, p = 0.04. Chemo and/or radiotherapy were given to 51% (18) of the patients without any significant benefit on survival (p = 0.79) or re-intervention rate (p = 0.47) compared to those who did not. SEMS is effective in palliating dysphagia in inoperable EC without major complications. Rates of tumors in growth and migration were comparable to other studies. SEMS provides long-term palliation.",

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of <i>Blastocystis</i> in children with celiac disease (CeD) or functional abdominal pain (FAP) and to evaluate its subtypes (STs) with respect to demographic, socioeconomic and epidemiological factors. Overall, 161 fecal samples were collected from healthy children and patients with FAP or CeD in Hitit University Erol Olçok Research and Training Hospital, Corum, Turkey between 2016-2018. Samples were examined using both native-Lugol (NL) and trichrome-stained (TS) smears, and further analyses by PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed. A standard questionnaire was applied to obtain demographic, socioeconomic, epidemiological data. <i>Blastocystis</i> was found in 10.6% of the total study population. Neither bacteria nor any other parasites were found, except for one <i>Giardia</i> (0.6%) in the CeD group. The presence/absence of the parasite was not found to be associated with demographic, socioeconomic and epidemiological factors. <i>Blastocysis</i> was detected in 11.5% (6/52) of the CeD, 7.7% (4/52) of the FAP, and 12.3% (7/57) of the healthy group. Diagnostic methods were similar in terms of <i>Blastocystis</i> detection (<i>P</i>= 0.671), and there was fair agreement between the NL, TS and PCR (Fleiss' Kappa=0.847, <i>P</i>=0.001). ST2 (42.8%) and ST3 (35.7%) were the predominant STs followed by ST1 (21.4%). We observed no difference between study groups in terms of <i>Blastocystis</i> prevalence. ST1, ST2 and ST3 subtypes were detected. <i>Blastocystis</i> prevalence and STs were not related to any of the demographic, socioeconomic and epidemiological factors.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic helped us understand that telemedicine provides an alternative way to manage patients remotely, with an added benefit of saving time and travel costs. However, barriers may exist in an older population of patients such as inadequate technology availability and knowledge, and lack of internet connectivity. This systematic review and analysis of data at an academic medical center examines the current literature and investigates the efficacy of telemedicine for older adults requiring gastrointestinal care. In the systematic review, we included 22 manuscripts from an initial 120 that were identified based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this existing literature, telemedicine visits were equivalent or better than in-person visits based on many metrics, including patient satisfaction, time and money saved, and standard patient outcomes. At a rural academic medical center, there was a steady decrease in the failure rate of telemedicine visits from April 2020 to May 2022 in all age groups, including the 65 + age group, from 17% in April 2020 to 3% in May 2022. Telemedicine offers a comparable alternative to in-person visits that is convenient, low-cost, and does not compromise quality of care for older patients obtaining GI care. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated progress and uptake of telemedicine, and the successful use by all ages including older patients opens the broader conversation about the continued use of telemedicine for care in various areas of medicine.",

        "Abstract": "The management of mid and low rectal cancer is based on neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by standardised surgery. There is no biomarker in rectal cancer to aid clinicians in foreseeing treatment response. The determination of factors associated with treatment response might allow the identification of patients who require tailored strategies (eg, therapeutic de-escalation or intensification). Colibactin-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (CoPEC) has been associated with aggressive colorectal cancer and could be a poor prognostic factor. Currently, no study has evaluated the potential association between intestinal microbiota composition and tumour response to CRT in mid and low rectal cancer. The aim of this study is to assess the association between response to neoadjuvant CRT and faecal intestinal microbiota composition and/or CoPEC prevalence in patients with mid or low rectal cancer. This is a non-randomised bicentric prospective clinical study with a recruitment capacity of 200 patients. Three stool samples will be collected from participants with histological-proven adenocarcinome of mid or low rectum who meet eligibility criteria of the study protocol: one before neoadjuvant treatment start, one in the period between CRT end and surgery and one the day before surgery. In each sample, CoPEC will be detected by culture in special media and molecular (PCR) approaches. The global microbiota composition will be also assessed by the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Neoadjuvant CRT response and tumour regression grade will be described using the Dworak system at pathological examination. Clinical data and survival outcomes will also be collected and investigated. MICARE was approved by the local ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est II, 18 December 2019.

        "Abstract": "Fibrosis of the liver is a degenerative alteration that occurs in the majority of chronic liver disorders. Further progression can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which can seriously affect the health and lives of patients. The field of liver fibrosis research has flourished in the last 20 years, with approximately 9000 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database alone. In order to identify future research hotspots and potential paths in a thorough and scientifically reliable manner, it is important to organize and visualize the research on this topic from a holistic and very general perspective. This study used bibliometric analysis with CiteSpace and VOSviewer software to provide a quantitative analysis, hotspot mining, and commentary of articles published in the field of liver fibrosis over the last 20 years. This bibliometric analysis contains a total of 8994 articles with 45667 authors from 6872 institutions in 97 countries, published in 1371 journals and citing 156 309 references. The literature volume has steadily increased over the last 20 years. Research has focused on gastroenterology and hepatology, pharmacology and pharmacy, and medicine, research, and experimental areas. We found that the pathological mechanisms, diagnostic and quantitative methods, etiology, and antifibrotic strategies constitute the knowledge structure of liver fibrosis. Finding mechanisms for liver fibrosis regression, identifying precise noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and creating efficient liver fibrosis patient treatments are the main goals of current research.",

While for many years diverticulitis was found to be mainly an event occurring in the elder population, more recent work in epidemiology demonstrates increasing frequency in younger subjects. In addition, there is a noticeable trend towards more complicated disease. This may explain the significant increase in hospitalisations observed in recent years. It is not a surprise that the number of scientific studies addressing the clinical and socioeconomic consequences in the field is increasing. As a result, diagnosis and conservative as well as surgical management have changed in recent years. Diverticulosis, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are a complex entity and apparently an interdisciplinary challenge. To meet theses considerations the German Societies for Gastroenterology and Visceral Surgery decided to create joint guidelines addressing all aspects in a truely interdisciplinary fashion. The aim of the guideline is to summarise and to evaluate the current state of knowledge on diverticulosis and diverticular disease and to develop statements as well as recommendations to all physicians involved in the management of patients with diverticular disease.",

        "Title": "The Delta Delta: Gaps in screening and patient assessment for hepatitis D virus infection.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection is highly prevalent in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). AASLD guidelines recommend a risk-based screening approach. Our aim was to ascertain if the risk-based approach leads to appropriate HDV screening, identify targets to improve screening rates, and study HDV clinical burden. CHB patients screened for HDV from 01/2016 to 12/2021 were identified. Level of training and specialty of providers ordering HDV screening tests were determined. HDV seropositive (HDV+) patient charts were reviewed for the presence of individual risk factors per the AASLD guidelines to determine if they met screening criteria. The severity of liver disease at the time of HDV screening was compared between the HDV+ group and a matched (based on age, hepatitis B e antigen status, BMI and sex) HDV seronegative (HDV-) group. During the study period, 1444/11,190 CHB patients were screened for HDV. Most screening tests were ordered by gastroenterology (90.2%) specialists and attending physicians (80.5%). HDV+ rate was 88/1444 (6%), and 72 HDV+ patients had complete information for analysis. 18% of HDV+ patients would be missed by a risk-based screening approach due to unreported or negative risk factors (see Table). A significantly higher number of HDV+ patients had developed significant fibrosis (p = 0.001) and cirrhosis (p < 0.01) by the time of screening than HDV- (n = 67) patients. In conclusion, targeted interventions are needed towards trainees and primary care clinics to improve screening rates. Current risk-based criteria do not appropriately screen for HDV. It is time for universal screening of HDV in CHB patients.",

        "Abstract": "Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is frequent after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Although often associated with postoperative pancreatic fistula, the precise pathogenesis in patients with no underlying complications remains unclear. There is evidence to suggest that, after surgery, aberrant electrical pathways are formed in the stomach which could contribute to the development of DGE.Gastric Alimetry is a novel technology which measures the electrical activity of the stomach non-invasively using an array of electrodes applied to the skin of the abdomen. This technique, termed body surface gastric mapping (BSGM), has been validated in normal controls and in patients with functional dyspepsia syndromes. This study will investigate the efficacy and feasibility of using BSGM to assess gastric motility in patients who undergo PD. This prospective cohort study will be conducted at a single large volume hepatobiliary unit in the UK. 50 patients who are planned to undergo PD will be included. BSGM measurement will be performed at four timepoints viz: preoperatively, day 4 postoperatively, at discharge and 6 months postoperatively. Key parameters of BSGM measurement, including wave amplitude, frequency and directional vector, will be measured at each timepoint and compared between different patient subgroups. Symptoms will be self-reported by patients during the recording using an iPad application designed for this purpose. Quality of life and patient experience will be assessed using standardised questionnaires at the end of the follow-up period. The protocol has been approved by the research ethics committees of Newcastle University and the Health Research Authority (HRA) of the UK (ethical approval IRAS ID 305302). Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. This study will automatically be registered with the ISRCTN registry by the HRA as part of the ethics approval process.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have investigated the prognostic value of the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). However, the results have been inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively determine the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of PNI in GISTs. This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Pooled HRs and 95% CIs were calculated to estimate the prognostic value of PNI in patients with GISTs. Combined ORs and corresponding 95% CIs were used to evaluate the association between the PNI and clinicopathological characteristics. The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library were thoroughly searched from inception to December 2021. A random-effects model or fixed-effects model was selected based on the level of heterogeneity among the included studies. Eight studies comprising 2307 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A low PNI was significantly associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.47, p<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (HR 4.35, 95% CI 1.25 to 16.83, p=0.033) in patients with GISTs. In addition, a low PNI was significantly associated with tumour size ≥5 cm (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.24, p=0.002) and primary tumour site in small intestine/colorectum/extra-GISTs (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.26, p=0.004). Patients with GISTs and a lower PNI had inferior RFS and OS. Patients with GISTs and a low PNI may have a higher risk of tumour recurrence.",

        "Abstract": "Telehealth in ophthalmology has traditionally focused on preventive disease screening with limited use in outpatient evaluation. The unique conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic afforded the opportunity to evaluate different implementations of teleophthalmology at scale, providing insight into expanding teleophthalmology care. To compare telehealth use in ophthalmology with other specialties and assess the feasibility of augmenting ophthalmic telehealth encounters with asynchronous testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. This quality improvement study evaluated retrospective, longitudinal, observational data from the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January 1, 2020, through July 31, 2021) for 881 080 patients receiving care from outpatient primary care, cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology, surgery, neurosurgery, urology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, obstetrics/gynecology, and ophthalmology clinics of the University of California, San Francisco. Asynchronous testing was evaluated for teleophthalmology encounters. A hybrid care model wherein ophthalmic testing data were acquired asynchronously and used to augment telehealth encounters. Telehealth as a percentage of total volume of ambulatory care and use of asynchronous testing for ophthalmic conditions. The volume of in-person outpatient visits dropped by 83.3% (39 488 of 47 390) across the evaluated specialties at the onset of shelter-in-place orders for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the initial use of telehealth increased for these specialties before stabilizing over the 18-month study period. In ophthalmology, telehealth use peaked at 488 of 1575 encounters (31.0%) early in the pandemic and returned to mostly in-person visits as COVID-19 restrictions lifted. Elective use of telehealth was highest in gastroenterology, urology, neurology, and neurosurgery and lowest in ophthalmology. Asynchronous testing was combined with 126 teleophthalmology encounters, resulting in change of clinical management for 32 patients (25.4%) and no change for 91 (72.2%). Telehealth increased across various specialties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Combining teleophthalmic visits with asynchronous testing suggested that this approach is feasible for subspecialty-level evaluation. Additional study is needed to evaluate whether asynchronous testing outside the same institution could provide an effective and lasting approach for expanding the reach of ophthalmic telehealth.",

        "Abstract": "Nutrition monitoring is essential in feeding tube-dependent patients receiving home enteral nutrition (HEN). We identified lack of consistency in dietitian evaluations for our pediatric patients receiving HEN. Consequently, after establishing an institutional standard for nutrition reassessment intervals, we underwent a quality improvement (QI) initiative to improve rates of adherence to standard frequency of dietitian consults and referrals among patients receiving HEN. A prospective QI initiative from April 2021 to December 2021 was performed using multiple plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Interventions included (1) a reminder placard, (2) the display of feeding tube status and date of the last dietitian note in the electronic health record (EHR) clinic schedule dashboard, and (3) an autotext smart element to the EHR default clinic note template. The goal was to enable clinicians to quickly identify the need for nutrition evaluation with either a same-day dietitian consult or a referral to nutrition clinic. Among 111 HEN patients with >6 months since last nutrition encounter, the dietitian referral/consult rate prior to any interventions was 58%. The placard (PDSA 1) was abandoned before obtaining reportable data because of sampling bias and clinic workflow inefficiencies. The clinic schedule dashboard modification (PDSA 2) improved the dietitian referral/consult rate to 66%. Subsequently, the clinic note smart element (PDSA 3) increased the rate to 77%. An 8-week postintervention check revealed a compliance rate of 78%. Implementation of minimally interruptive EHR enhancements showed a sustained increase in dietitian referrals and consults for patients receiving HEN, which may improve nutrition outcomes.",

We evaluate the coverage, variability, and ability to identify differential DNA methylation of RRBS and MMB. We show that MMB is an effective tool for profiling the murine methylome that performs comparably with RRBS, identifying similar differentially methylated pathways. Although choice of technology is experiment dependent and will be predicated on the underlying biology being probed, these analyses provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach.",

This guideline was developed by clinical appraisal and review of the evidence, available clinical guidelines, and in consultation with members of the Isfahan Chamber of Iranian association of gastroenterology and hepatology. In screening people with average risk for CRC who use personal resources and personally pay all the costs, colonoscopy is recommended as the first choice to be done every 10 years. In case of negative colonoscopy, we recommend FIT test to prevention of interval cancer every 5 years. In screening of people with average risk of CRC, FIT is suggested to be done every 2 years as a first-choice method test for those who use public resources and do not pay for this service personally. In screening individuals with average risk for CRC, g-FOBT is not recommended as the first method of choice. Repeating positive guaiac test is not recommended and if positive, colonoscopy is suggested.",

Simultaneously, physicians' attribution of GI symptoms to underlying psychological issues is not readily accepted by patients and can negatively affect the clinical rapport between doctor and patient. In reality, psychosocial aspects are involved in many functional disorders and organic diseases, not just in mental disorders. Time is overdue for gastroenterologists to recognise the inadequacy and limitations of conventional gastroenterology and consider the role of psychological, social and biological variables throughout the entire clinical course of the illness, as is shown in George Engel's model. This review discusses the following: (1) the current challenges of using the conventional clinical model for both functional and organic GI illness, (2) the inadequacy and limitations of explaining GI symptoms simply as psychological disorders, (3) the exploration of the symptom-centred, stepped reattribution clinical model, (4) the clarification of psychosomatic medical concepts for use in gastroenterology, and (5) the significance of a systematic and interdisciplinary framework for a comprehensive psychosomatic model in gastroenterology.",

        "Abstract": "Background Sensory processing dysfunction in children has been linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, feeding disorders, and functional abdominal pain. However, little is known about sensory processing in the broader pediatric gastroenterology population. Objective To characterize frequency and type of sensory processing dysfunction seen in pediatric gastroenterology compared to a general pediatric population. Methods The Short Sensory Profile 2 was administered to the parents of children ranging 3-14 years, being seen in a pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic or general pediatric clinic. Short Sensory Profile 2 scores from age- and gender-matched groups were compared with nonparametric statistics. Results Sensory processing dysfunction was increased in children seen in the GI clinic compared to children in the general pediatric clinic. Short Sensory Profile 2 quadrant analysis revealed greatest differences in avoiding, primarily in young females of the GI population. Conclusion Children presenting to a pediatric GI clinic demonstrate greater sensory processing dysfunction compared to children in a general pediatric practice.",

We present the case of a man in his 60ss with a large-bowel obstruction with symptoms including a 4-day history of progressive abdominal pain, distension, vomiting and absolute constipation. On examination, his abdomen was distended with tinkling bowel sounds on auscultation. Cross-sectional imaging demonstrated an obstructing mass in the distal descending colon. An emergency laparoscopic Hartmann's procedure was performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. An intraoperative colonoscopy demonstrated numerous white threadworms in the colon. Histological analysis demonstrated a pseudotumour related to Enterobius vermicularis infection. This case represents a rare differential diagnosis for a large-bowel obstruction.",

        "Abstract": "The risk of hepatitis B reactivation in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative phase of hepatitis B virus-infected patients exposed to biologic agents is not clear. We aimed to investigate the reactivation rate in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative phase of hepatitis B virus-infected patients after biologic therapy. Patients followed at gastroenterology, rheumatology, and dermatology clinics with a diagnosis of immune-mediated inflam matory diseases were screened. Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases patients exposed to biologic agents with a negative hepatitis B surface antigen and positive hepatitis B core immunoglobulin G antibody were included in the study. We screened 8266 immune-mediated inflammatory disease patients, and 2484 patients were identified as exposed to biologic agents. Two hundred twenty-one patients were included in the study. The mean age was 54.08 ± 11.69 years, and 115 (52.0%) patients were female. The median number of different biologic subtype use was 1 (range: 1-6). The mean biologic agent exposure time was 55 (range: 2-179) months. One hundred and fifty-two (68.8%) patients used a concomitant immunomodulatory agent, and 84 (38.0%) patients were exposed to corticosteroids during biologic use. No hepatitis B reactivation with a reverse seroconversion of hepatitis B surface antigen positivity was seen. Antiviral prophylaxis for hepatitis B was applied to 48 (21.7%) patients. Hepatitis B virus-DNA was screened in 56 (25.3%) patients prior to the biologic exposure. Two patients without antiviral prophylaxis had hepatitis B virus-DNA reactivation with a negative hepatitis B surface antigen during exposure to the biologic agent. We found 2 reactivations and no hepatitis B surface antigen seroconversion in our cohort. Antiviral prophylaxis for patients exposed to biologic agents may need to be discussed in more detail.",

        "Abstract": "The sudden and intense burden due to the novel coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has changed the priority of many health services. The highly contagious new variants and vaccination services have greatly impacted the daily practice of gastroenterologists. In the present study, we tried to evaluate the change in the daily practice of Turkish gastroenterologists in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the post-vaccination periods. A questionnaire was prepared using Google forms and sent online to 214 gastroenterologists registered with the Turkish Gastroenterology Association. Approximately half of the gastroenterologists moved their endoscopy unit or gastroenterology clinic to another location in the hospital during the pandemic and about one-third of the endoscopy units were completely closed. About 56% of the respondents reported the interruption of endoscopic procedures and inpatient services. In total, 85% of gastroenterologists thought that follow-up and treatment of chronic patients were disrupted due to patients obtaining their medicine directly from pharmacies. After the first case in Turkey, 74% of gastroenterologists worked in coronavirus disease 2019 patient care services, 28% of gastroenterologists were infected with coronavirus disease 2019, and 3% believed they had a cross-infected patient(s). A total of 78% of gastroenterologists reported that patient management became difficult due to the change in the priority of other departments, and 60% of gastroenterologists confirmed that they experienced a decrease in income. In the post-vaccination period, 70% of gastroenterologists returned to their pre-pandemic working schedule and 31% noticed an increase in endoscopic cancer detection. Prolongation of the pandemic has seriously damaged the practice of gastroenterology and multidisciplinary patient management.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the diagnostic value and application of 24 h multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (24 h MII-pH) monitoring in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). <b>Methods:</b> This is a cross-sectional study. From January 2013 to December, 2020, 417 patients who received 24 h MII-pH monitoring in Department of Gastroenterology of Children's Hospital Capital Institute of Pediatrics were included. According to results, these children were divided into the GERD and non-GERD groups. Furthermore, the 132 children with GERD who had gastroscopy were divided into the reflux esophagitis (RE) and non-erosive reflux disease (NE) groups to investigate the differences in their refluxes. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test or indepentent sample <i>t</i> test was used for comparisons between the groups. <b>Results:</b> Among the 417 children, 232 were males and 185 females, aged (7.3±3.9) years. The course of disease was 0.5 (0.1, 2.0) years. The main clinical symptoms included acid reflux (128 cases), vomiting (173 cases), abdominal pain (101 cases), and cough (76 cases). The 24 h MII-pH monitoring were positive in 243 children (58.3%, 243/417), which was higher than that by 24 h esophageal pH monitoring (43.6%, 182/417). The 24 h MII-pH monitoring results demonstrated significant differences in the episodes of acid reflux, weakly acidic reflux, non-acidic reflux, liquid reflux and mixed reflux between GERD and non-GERD groups (10 (4, 19) <i>vs</i>. 4 (1, 9) times/24 h, 14 (6, 32) <i>vs</i>. 7 (3, 13) times/24 h, 0 (0, 0) <i>vs</i>. 0 (0, 0) times/24 h, 19 (10, 34) <i>vs</i>. 8 (3, 14) times/24 h, and 6 (2, 12) <i>vs</i>. 3 (1, 5) times/24 h, <i>Z</i>=-6.96, -7.25, -5.62, -8.75, and -6.48, all <i>P</i><0.05, respectively). Besides, the results also showed significant differences in Boix-Ochoa score, episodes of long reflux, course of long reflux, and episodes of weakly acidic reflux between the RE and NE groups (51.2 (21.4, 153.2) <i>vs</i>. 20.7 (12.1, 34.7), 5 (2, 10) <i>vs</i>. 1 (0, 4) times/24 h, 19 (7, 87) <i>vs</i>. 8 (3, 22) min, and 5 (2, 15) <i>vs</i>. 15 (6, 33) times/24 h, <i>Z</i>=-3.44, -3.41, -2.65, and -2.27, all <i>P</i><0.05, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> 24 h MII-pH monitoring not only improves the detection rate of GERD in children, but also provides a possibility to early etiological diagnosis.",

This review discusses the reasons for lowering the age, adenomatous polyp detection rates for patients 45-49, and to discover innovative health education campaigns aimed at younger patients. There are currently approximately 20 million Americans between the age of 45-49 who will need to be screened by gastroenterologists. The prevalence of overall and advanced colorectal neoplasia on screening colonoscopy for average-risk individuals younger than 50 years is 14% and 2%. An important 2022 study using the GI Quality Improvement Consortium Registry demonstrated that patients aged 45-49 had an overall adenoma detection rate of >25%. Health education campaigns need to immediately target 20 million Americans to begin colorectal cancer screening. Additional research should focus on whether there are sex differences for adenoma detection rates among patients aged 46-49. Innovative health education campaigns such as \"Tune It Up: A Concert To Raise Colorectal Cancer\" organized by the American College of Gastroenterology are educating younger patients to begin colorectal screening by combining concerts and health communication.",

        "Abstract": "Endoscopic gastritis is associated with symptoms of gastritis, along with endoscopic findings. Amlapitta Mishran has multiple active components that act via various mechanisms in patients with gastritis symptoms. We planned to conduct this study to find out the efficacy and safety of Amlapitta Mishran in patients with endoscopic gastritis. To find out efficacy of Amlapitta Mishran in patient with endoscopic gastritis. This study was an open-label, prospective, single-center study. Thirty participants were recruited, and Amlapitta Mishran Suspension was given for 30 days. Blood investigations for safety were performed at baseline (Visit 1), on Visit 3 and Visit 4. Endoscopy was performed at baseline and Visit 4, and stomach erosion score was recorded. Amlapitta Symptom Rating Scale score, Postprandial Distress Syndrome (PPDS) score, and Epigastric Pain Syndrome (EPS) score were efficacy endpoints. Out of the 30 participants recruited, 28 participants completed the study. The median age of participants in the study was 26.50 years. A statistically significant (P<0.05) reduction was seen in endoscopy score at Visit 4 as compared to baseline (Visit 1) by Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Amlapitta Symptom Rating Scale score, PPDS score, EPS score also exhibited significant reduction (P < 0.05) at Visit 3 and Visit 4 as compared to baseline by Friedman's test with post hoc analysis. No statistically significant reduction was seen in these scores from Visit 3 to Visit 4, except for the EPS score. At the end of Visit 4, 18 (64%) participants had an endoscopy score of 1 (no erosions). At the end of Visit 4, ≥ 50% improvement was seen in Amlapitta Symptom Rating Scale score in 27 (96%) participants, PPDS score improved by ≥ 50% in 25 (89%) participants, and EPS score improved by ≥ 50% in 26 (93%) participants. All safety variables including laboratory investigation were within the normal range in all visits. Amlapitta Mishran Suspension effectively reduced endoscopic gastritis scores in the participants and reduced the symptoms of gastritis measured by the Amlapitta Symptom Rating Scale, PPDS, and EPS scores with no adverse events.",

        "Abstract": "There are many well-described potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of pancreatic resection that can cause patients to suffer from chronic malabsorption, diarrhea, and persistent nausea. These GI symptoms can affect postoperative recovery, initiation of adjuvant therapy, and overall quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this study is to quantify the incidence of post-procedural complications and identify patients at higher risk for experiencing GI dysfunction after pancreatectomy. A retrospective review of patients who underwent pancreatic resection at a single institution between January 2014 and December 2019 was performed. Demographics, operative factors, and postoperative gastrointestinal symptomatology and treatments were obtained by chart review. Significance tests were performed to compare GI dysfunction between patient subgroups. A total of 545 patients underwent pancreatic resection; within the cohort 451 patients (83%) underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and the most common indication was pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Two-thirds of patients (67%) reported gastrointestinal symptoms persisting beyond hospitalization. Only 105 patients (20%) were referred to gastroenterology for evaluation with 30 patients (5.5%) receiving a formal diagnosis. Patients who underwent PD were more likely to report GI symptoms and patients who identified as Caucasian were more likely to be referred to gastroenterology for evaluation. Gastrointestinal dysfunction after pancreatic resection occurs frequently yet only a small percentage of patients are referred for formal testing and diagnosis. There also appears to be a racial difference in referral patterns. Patients would benefit if earlier attention was dedicated to the diagnosis and corresponding treatment for postoperative digestive health disorders to optimize treatment planning and QOL.",

Our objective was to verify if, after the start of the pandemic, there was an increase in in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to a Gastroenterology Service of a 3rd level hospital. The 1039 admissions registered at the Virgen de la Victoria University Hospital in Malaga (Spain) were retrospectively analysed in the period between 1 December 2019 and 30 November 2020 (12 months), which were divided into 4 quarters (pre-wave, first wave, inter-wave and second wave) and mortality and other variables (globally and by disease group) were analysed. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of overall in-hospital mortality in the different periods. (p 0.23). The greatest burden of disease corresponded to biliopancreatic group and, within them, acute pancreatitis (p 0.04), followed by non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding. In the second semester, mortality increased in the biliopancreatic group (p 0.01). Patients admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding took longer to request care after the start of the pandemic, especially in the second wave (p 0.03). The same was observed in admissions due to tumours, with the time elapsed until the emergency visit more than double in the second semester, with a consequent increase in mortality (p 0.00). The global in-hospital mortality in a Gastroenterology Service in a 3rd level hospital has not increased with the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, however, a higher in-hospital mortality has been recorded in biliopancreatic diseases and digestive tumours diagnosed on an in-patient basis between June and November 2020.",

        "Title": "Biologics for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Clinical Practice: A Calabria (Southern Italy) Prospective Pharmacovigilance Study.",
        "Abstract": "The use of immune-modifying biological agents has markedly changed the clinical course and the management of Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Active post-marketing surveillance programs are fundamental to early recognize expected and unexpected adverse events (AEs), representing a powerful tool to better determine the safety profiles of biologics in a real-world setting. This study aimed to identify the occurrence of AEs and therapeutic failures linked to biological drugs used in gastroenterology units during a prospective pharmacovigilance program in Southern Italy. Patients affected by IBDs and treated with a biologic agent, from 1 January 2019, to 31 December 2021 (study period) in three gastroenterology units were enrolled. Overall, 358 patients with a diagnosis of active Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis satisfying inclusion criteria have been enrolled. Infliximab (IFX) was the most administered drug at the index date (214; 59.8%), followed by Adalimumab (ADA; 89; 24.9%), Golimumab (GOL; 37; 10.3%), Vedolizumab (VDZ; 17; 4.7%) and Ustekimumab (UST; 1; 0.3%). Seventy-three patients (20.4%) experienced at least one AE, while 62 patients (17.3%) had therapeutic ineffectiveness. No serious AEs were reported in the follow-up period in the enrolled patients. AEs have been described with IFX (50/214; <i>p</i> = 0.47), GOL (7/37; <i>p</i> = 0.78), ADA (13/89; <i>p</i> = 0.18), and VDZ (3/17; <i>p</i> = 0.52), no AEs have been noticed with UST (0/1). Based on the low rate of AEs observed and withdrawal from treatment, our data seem to corroborate the favorable beneficial/risk profile of biologics for IBDs.",

        "Abstract": "The Korean Society of Gastroenterology (KSG) and the Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (KSGE) have tried to promote high-quality patient care, and safety in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. In 2017, the training guidelines for GI fellows have been made, and the education board of KSGE revised 2 year- program of GI fellows. The guideline includes the total number of assigned patients, the number of GI endoscopy procedures, attendance of academic conferences, and research presentations. The traditional training model of GI fellowship is known as an \"apprenticeship\". Unfortunately, it might increase confusion between what trainees are observing and prior information. Now, practical hands-on training system using simulator helps to provide a support program for GI fellowship education. In order to facilitate training program, trainers will need to carefully plan the teaching. Therefore, it improves knowledge and performance for trainers. What we should keep in mind is that this hands-on program has the goal of making a good gastroenterologist, not just making an endoscopist. At same time, the application of cognitive education in GI fellow training must be performed. On the other side, the privileging and credentialing for endoscopic subspecialty should be made. The provision of benefits could serve as an important foundation for maintaining GI specialist board system.",

Therefore, abdominal US education for internal medicine residents was mandated by the Korean Association of Internal Medicine. However, US education for physicians has been conducted only in some university hospitals that directly perform abdominal US examinations in internal medicine, or some education is provided with the help of radiologists. US technology continues to become increasingly widespread, portable, and miniaturized. Furthermore, point-of-care US, i.e., US executed at the patient's bedside to obtain real-time objective information with diagnostic and clinical monitoring purposes or to guide invasive procedures, has been incorporated in many specialties. Despite the increasing role of US, there is no systemized abdominal US education program. Therefore, the authors are trying to develop a structured abdominal US education program through cooperation with related US organizations.",

        "Abstract": "Colonoscopy quality can vary depending on endoscopist-related factors. Quality indicators, such as adenoma detection rate (ADR), have been adopted to reduce variations in care. Several interventions aim to improve ADR, but these fall into several domains that have traditionally been difficult to compare. We will conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacies of interventions to improve colonoscopy quality and report our findings according to clinically relevant interventional domains. We will search MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and Evidence-Based Medicine from inception to September 2022. Four reviewers will screen for eligibility and abstract data in parallel, with two accordant entries establishing agreement and with any discrepancies resolved by consensus. The primary outcome will be ADR. Two authors will independently conduct risk of bias assessments. The analyses of the network will be conducted under a Bayesian random-effects model using Markov-chain Monte-Carlo simulation, with 10 000 burn-ins and 100 000 iterations. We will calculate the ORs and corresponding 95% credible intervals of network estimates with a consistency model. We will report the impact of specific interventions within each domain against standard colonoscopy. We will perform a Bayesian random-effects pairwise meta-analysis to assess heterogeneity based on the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. We will assess the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework for network meta-analyses. Our study does not require research ethics approval given the lack of patient-specific data being collected. The results will be disseminated at national and international gastroenterology conferences and peer-reviewed journals. CRD42021291814.",

        "Title": "Matched Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty and Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Cases: Formative Cohort Study.",
        "Abstract": "Bariatric weight-loss surgery rates are increasing internationally. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a novel, minimally invasive endoscopic procedure thought to mimic some of the effects of a more common surgery, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Patient factors affecting procedural choice are unexplored. This formative study aimed to determine the preoperative and early postoperative characteristics of adults matched for age, sex, and BMI who chose ESG versus LSG. This prospective cohort study recruited ESG and matched LSG adults in Australia. Preoperative outcomes were medical history, glycemic biomarkers, blood lipids, liver function enzymes, albumin, blood pressure, hepatic steatosis index, the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite questionnaire, and body composition via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Adverse events were recorded preoperatively and up to 2 weeks postoperatively. SPSS was used to test if there were differences between cohorts by comparing means or mean ranks, and binary regression was used to understand how characteristics might predict procedure choice. A total of 50 (including 25 ESG and 25 LSG) patients were recruited, who were primarily White (45/50, 90%) and female (41/50, 82%) with a mean age of 41.7 (SD 9.4) years. Participants had a mean of 4.0 (SD 2.2) active comorbid conditions, with the most common being nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (38/50, 76%), back pain (32/50, 64%), anxiety or depression (24/50, 48%), and joint pain (23/50, 46%). The LSG cohort had higher hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (5.3%, SD 0.2%) than the ESG cohort (5%, SD 0.2%; P=.008). There was a 2.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> difference in median BMI (P=.03) between the groups, but fat and fat-free mass had no meaningful differences. Comparing the LSG and ESG groups showed that the LSG group had lower total quality of life (49.5%, SD 10.6% vs 56.6%, SD 12.7%; P=.045), lower weight-related self-esteem (10.7%, IQR 3.6%-25% vs 25%, IQR 17.9%-39.3%; P=.02), and worse abdominal pain (38.9%, IQR 33.3%-50% vs 53.9%, SD 14.2%, P=.01). For every percent improvement in weight-related self-esteem, the odds for selecting ESG increased by 4.4% (95% CI 1.004-1.085; P=.03). For every percent worsening in hunger pain, the odds for selecting ESG decreased by 3.3% (95% CI 0.944-0.990; P=.004). There was very little evidence that Australian adults who chose an endoscopic versus surgical sleeve had different rates of comorbidities, body fat percentage, or weight-related quality of life. There was evidence against the test hypothesis, that is, there was evidence suggesting that lower self-esteem predicted choosing a more invasive sleeve (ie, LSG rather than ESG).

        "Abstract": "Invasive gastrointestinal surgery may be performed as an open or endoscopic procedure, such as laparoscopic semi-colon surgery, laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic gastrectomy, and anal surgery, among other such operations. Regardless of the approach, the operative procedure interferes with the patient's gastrointestinal tract, necessitating the rational use of prophylactic antibiotics to improve treatment outcomes and minimize postoperative infections. To investigate the prophylactic and postoperative antibiotic usage in patients who underwent invasive gastrointestinal surgery, and to identify factors associated with postoperative infection. This descriptive, cross-sectional study included 112 patients who underwent invasive gastrointestinal surgery at the Department of Gastroenterology, Thong Nhat Hospital. We conducted a cross-sectional study in all inpatients aged 18 years and older, who underwent invasive gastrointestinal surgery between January 2020 and December 2020. We recorded patient characteristics, the administration and appropriateness of antibiotics, as well as treatment outcomes. The appropriateness of prophylactic and postoperative antibiotic usage was assessed based on 2015 Vietnamese national guideline for antibiotic use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with postoperative infection. Patients' mean age was 59.7 ± 17.2 years. Most surgeries (89.3%) were clean-contaminated procedures. The rates of appropriate types of antibiotics selected, doses, and overall rates of appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were 68.0%, 76.4% and 54.7%, respectively. Of the patients investigated, 34.8% had at least one sign of postoperative infection; the overall appropriate rate of postoperative antibiotic was 38.5%. Old age was associated with postoperative infection and longer length of hospitalization. Implementation of the guidelines recommended for the prophylactic and therapeutic use of antibiotics is essential to improve treatment outcomes.",

The diagnosis of urolithiasis was confirmed by plain films, ultrasonography, abdominal computed tomography or intravenous urography. The clinical data of patients were collected, and the association between the clinical characteristics and urolithiasis was further analyzed. The fecal samples were collected from 10 patients with urolithiasis and 18 patients without urolithiasis, and the gut microbiota and metabolites composition were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> There were 49 male and 19 female IBD patients with urolithiasis, with a mean age of (36.0±12.4) years, and 98 male and 38 female patients without urolithiasis, with a mean age of (36.1±12.5) years. Univariate analysis revealed that the rate of ileostomy and the resection of small intestine in Crohn's disease (CD) patients with urolithiasis (<i>n</i>=34) was significantly higher than CD patients without urolithiasis (<i>n</i>=68) (26.5% vs 7.4%, <i>P</i>=0.019). And the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was also higher [26.5 (12.0, 40.8) vs 13.0 (7.2, 32.5) mm/1 h, <i>P</i>=0.022] in CD patients with urolithiasis. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics and biochemical parameters between the ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with urolithiasis (<i>n</i>=34) and without urolithiasis (<i>n</i>=68) (all <i>P</i>>0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ileostomy and the resection of small intestine were the independent related factors for urolithiasis in CD patients (<i>OR</i>=4.619, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.178-18.111, <i>P</i>=0.028). There was no significant difference in α and β diversity between the two groups (all <i>P</i>>0.05). At the phylum level, there was no significant difference in the abundance of microbiota (all <i>P</i>>0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of <i>Enterococcus</i> (<i>P</i>=0.049), <i>Eubacterium_eligens</i> (<i>P</i>=0.036) was significantly decreased. At the species level, the abundance of <i>Bacteroides_coprocola</i> was increased in urolithiasis group (<i>P</i>=0.035), while the abundance of <i>Blautia_caecimuris</i> was significantly decreased (<i>P</i>=0.042). No significant difference was found in fecal metabolites between the two groups (all <i>P</i>>0.05). According to LDA effect size (Lefse) analysis, taxa including <i>Sphingomonadales</i>, <i>Fenollaria</i>, <i>Bacteroides_coprocola</i> contributed greatly to the difference between the two groups. <b>Conclusions:</b> Ileostomy and the resection of small intestine are related factors for urolithiasis in patients with CD. Gut microbiota may be involved in the occurrence of urolithiasis in patients with IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a non-communicable disease with a rising prevalence worldwide and with large burden for patients and health systems. To date, the presence of unique phenotypes in patients with NAFLD has not been studied, and their identification could inform precision medicine and public health with pragmatic implications in personalised management and care for patients with NAFLD. Cross-sectional and prospective (up to 31 December 2019) analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-1994). NAFLD diagnosis was based on liver ultrasound. The following predictors informed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-means): body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transferase. We summarised (means) and compared the predictors across clusters. We used Cox proportional hazard models to quantify the all-cause mortality risk associated with each cluster. 1652 patients with NAFLD (mean age 47.2 years and 51.5% women) were grouped into 3 clusters: anthro-SBP-glucose (6.36%; highest levels of anthropometrics, SBP and glucose), lipid-liver (10.35%; highest levels of lipid and liver enzymes) and average (83.29%; predictors at average levels). Compared with the average phenotype, the anthro-SBP-glucose phenotype had higher all-cause mortality risk (aHR=2.88; 95% CI: 2.26 to 3.67); the lipid-liver phenotype was not associated with higher all-cause mortality risk (aHR=1.11; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.42). There is heterogeneity in patients with NAFLD, whom can be divided into three phenotypes with different mortality risk. These phenotypes could guide specific interventions and management plans, thus advancing precision medicine and public health for patients with NAFLD.",

        "Title": "Addressing Self-Injurious Behavior in the Medically Complex Child: Identifying the Root Cause vs Blocking Resulting Behavior.",
        "Abstract": "Gillian is a 7-year-old nonverbal, internationally adopted girl with significant visual impairment (sees shadows and objects with high contrast), moderate-severe hearing loss, autism spectrum disorder, profound intellectual disability, and a seizure disorder. She resided in an orphanage until age 4 years when she was adopted by her mother. She is referred to the multidisciplinary team in developmental-behavioral pediatrics by her gastroenterologist, who is managing her constipation, for evaluation and management of self-injurious behavior that occurs before bowel movements.Gillian's adoptive mother reported that Gillian has a history of repetitive and self-injurious behavior including hitting her head with the palm of her hand and poking her eyes. The head-hitting behavior has resulted in consistent bruising to her forehead and nasal bridge. The eye poking is of significant concern because of the possibility of resultant injury including corneal abrasion or retinal detachment. Eye poking occurs exclusively during the hour before stooling, at home and school, and is accompanied by screaming, pacing, and increased aggression toward her mother/teachers. Mother typically responds by blocking the eye poking, redirecting Gillian to the toilet, providing prompts to use calming strategies (e.g., deep breathing), or providing sensory input by rubbing her arms/back. Teachers respond in a similar way at school. Gillian's mother has tried to place goggles over Gillian's eyes during eye poking, but this resulted in increased aggressive behaviors.Gillian is not fully bowel trained but will sit on the toilet to urinate when prompted. She completes toilet-sits at home/school 5 to 7 times daily. Gillian passes small, soft bowel movements 2 to 4 times daily on a bowel management regimen consisting of polyethylene glycol 3350 17 grams twice daily and liquid senna 8.8 mg daily. Seizures are reportedly well controlled with an antiepileptic medication managed by her neurologist. Previous medical evaluation by otolaryngology, ophthalmology, neurology, and gastroenterology did not identify a source of pain or other cause for the eye poking. Physical examination reveals normal bowel sounds and a mildly distended abdomen but is otherwise unremarkable. What are your next steps for evaluation and treatment?",

        "Abstract": "A quality improvement project in a secondary care centre was initiated to investigate and evaluate the impact of staff education and the use of the British Society of Gastroenterology/British Association for the Study of the Liver cirrhosis care bundle in improving care of patients admitted to hospital with decompensated liver cirrhosis. A staff training programme was implemented, involving around 30 health professionals consisting of consultants, junior doctors, physician associates and nurses from the acute medical unit. A review of electronic documentation and analysis of key clinical parameters, pre- and post-intervention, was carried out. The data show that the intervention has led to an improvement in patient management and clinical outcomes. This project illustrates that collaboration between hepatology and medical teams, with emphasis on education and training, benefits patients who present to hospital with decompensated liver cirrhosis.",

        "Title": "Four SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses or hybrid immunity in patients on immunosuppressive therapies: a Norwegian cohort study.",
        "Abstract": "Data on response and safety of repeated vaccinations and hybrid immunity in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases on immunosuppressive therapy is needed to further develop vaccination strategies in this vulnerable population. This study aimed to evaluate hybrid immunity and humoral immune response and safety of four SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases on immunosuppressive therapy. This prospective observational Norwegian study of vaccine response to COVID-19 (Nor-vaC) included adult patients aged 18 years and older with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis) on immunosuppressive therapy, who had received four SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses (vaccine group) or three vaccine doses followed by COVID-19 (hybrid group), and healthy controls receiving three vaccine doses (control group). Patients were recruited from the Division of Rheumatology at Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, and the Department of Gastroenterology at Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog. Patients who had COVID-19 before the third vaccine dose, and patients with allergies or intolerances to elements of the vaccine were excluded. Antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (anti-RBD antibodies) were assessed 2-4 weeks following vaccination or COVID-19. This study is registered at Clinialtrials.gov, NCT04798625. Between Nov 12, 2021, and April 19, 2022, 1458 participants with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases provided post-vaccination samples at 2-4 weeks following a third vaccine dose. After 544 participants were excluded, 715 (78%) of the remaining 914 participants received the fourth dose of the vaccine, and of these, 536 (75%) provided post-vaccination samples 2-4 weeks after their fourth vaccination (vaccine group). 199 (22%) of the 914 had COVID-19 after their third dose of the vaccine and of these, 167 (84%) provided samples (hybrid group). 256 of the eligible 703 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 107 had spondyloarthritis, 115 had psoriatic arthritis, 130 had Crohn's disease, and 95 had ulcerative colitis). Median age was 56 years [IQR 45-65], 398 (57%) were women, and 305 (43%) were men. Patients in the vaccine group had higher anti-RBD antibody concentrations following the fourth vaccine dose (median 6192 BAU/ml [IQR 2878-11 243]) than after the third dose (median 5087 BAU/ml [1250-9081]; p< 0·0001), but lower antibody concentrations than the control group following the third dose (median 7595 BAU/ml [5916-12 001]; p< 0·0001). Antibody concentrations were higher in the patients in the hybrid group (23 548 BAU/ml [IQR 11 440-35 935]) than in the vaccine group (p<0·0001). No difference was found in antibody concentrations between the fourth dose of BNT162b2 (full-dose) and mRNA-1273 (half-dose). Patients and controls had a comparable safety profile after both three and four vaccine doses. Vaccine boosters improve humoral immune responses and are safe in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases on immunosuppressive therapy, and administration should be considered regularly in this patient group. Hybrid immunity with omicron induces a strong humoral response suggesting longer intervals between booster doses in this patient group.

Over a 6-day course, she received a total of 13 g of intravenous acetaminophen not exceeding 4 g over a 24-hour period. She developed encephalopathy and an international normalised ratio of 6.1 meeting criteria for acute liver failure (ALF). She was treated with intravenous N-acetyl cysteine and other causes of liver failure were excluded. The patient was discharged with subsequent resolution of encephalopathy and improvement of her liver chemistries. Though ALF is rare, in countries where acetaminophen is readily available, almost 50% of ALF cases are acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and most have been documented as oral ingestion of acetaminophen. We present a rare case of intravenous acetaminophen-induced ALF.",

        "Abstract": "Graphical abstracts (GAs) have recently been included as an essential element in various journals, including those in the field of Gastroenterology & Hepatology. However, there has been no study on the effect of GAs on the impact factor (IF) of journals, and the citation index or social media exposure of individual articles. We investigated the presence of GAs, total citations and social media exposure of full-length original articles in the top ten journals of gastroenterology and hepatology for three years (2019-2021). Citations and social media exposure were evaluated with the Web of Science citation index, Altmetric Attention score, Dimension recorded citation count, and PlumX index. A total of 4,205 articles from ten journals were evaluated for three years. First, journals that have adopted GAs demonstrated significantly higher IF increases for the past three years than those of journals without GAs. The longer GAs have been utilized in a journal, the higher IFs the journal had. Secondly, individual articles with GAs had significantly higher Web of Science citation counts (median 14 vs. 12), more social media exposure (median 23 vs. 5) and more Altmetric.com tweet counts (median 15 vs. 7) than those of articles without GAs. In multiple regression analysis, the inclusion of GAs was particularly effective in increasing the number of Web of Science citations (β = 14.1, SE = 1.9, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and social media exposure (β = 13.3, SE = 6.1, <i>P</i> = 0.030) after adjusting for journal IFs and topics. GAs are effective in increasing IFs of journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology, as well as increasing citations and social media exposure of individual articles.",

        "Abstract": "Dyskinesia limited only to the axial musculature is very rare, and if it is localized to the anterior abdominal wall, it is called belly dancer's dyskinesia. Despite reports of variable clinical characteristics, a common feature is a myriad of involuntary, repetitive, sometimes painful, and often rhythmic movements of the anterior abdominal wall, with the majority being bilateral, resembling that of a belly dancer. As the symptom is mainly localized to the abdomen, patients could visit a gastroenterology service thinking it might be associated with underlying visceral pathology. Since the first report in 1990, only a few cases of belly dancer dyskinesia have been reported over the years. We herein report the case of a 54 years old female who presented to our OPD with a recurrent painless writhing movement of the abdomen, diagnosed as belly dancer dyskinesia and successfully treated with chlordiazepoxide.",

        "Abstract": "Diverticulosis and diverticular disease are ranked among the most common gastroenterological diseases and conditions. While for many years diverticulitis was found to be mainly an event occurring in the elder population, more recent work in epidemiology demonstrates increasing frequency in younger subjects. In addition, there is a noticeable trend towards more complicated disease. This may explain the significant increase in hospitalisations observed in recent years. It is not a surprise that the number of scientific studies addressing the clinical and socioeconomic consequences in the field is increasing. As a result, diagnosis and conservative as well as surgical management have changed in recent years. Diverticulosis, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are a complex entity and apparently an interdisciplinary challenge. To meet theses considerations the German Societies for Gastroenterology and Visceral Surgery decided to create joint guidelines addressing all aspects in a truely interdisciplinary fashion. The aim of the guideline is to summarise and to evaluate the current state of knowledge on diverticulosis and diverticular disease and to develop statements as well as recommendations to all physicians involved in the management of patients with diverticular disease.",

The distention started 2 years earlier and was not associated with any other constitutional symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hematemesis, or melaena. She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents. Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 µIU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 µIU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 µg/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 µg/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), β-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries. The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand and pelvis were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism. In view of the hypothyroidism, US of the neck was also performed. Treatment was started based on the clinical and radiologic parameters, and the child's condition improved with medical treatment.",

Repeat cross-sectional study. 19 journals listed in Google Scholar's Top Publications for health and medical sciences. Blood, Cell, Circulation, European Heart Journal, Gastroenterology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Nature Genetics, Nature Medicine, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron, PLoS ONE, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Science Translational Medicine, The British Medical Journal, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, The Lancet Oncology, and The New England Journal of Medicine. We used the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guideline and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) requirements for disclosing conflicts of interest (COIs) to evaluate journals standards. TOP scores slightly improved during the COVID-19 pandemic, from a median of 5 (IQR: 2-12.5) out of a possible 24 points in February 2020 to 7 (IQR: 4-12) in May 2021, but overall, scores were very low at both time points. Journal policies scored highest for their adherence to data transparency and scored lowest for preregistration of study protocols and analysis plans and the submission of replication studies. Most journals fulfilled all ICMJE provisions for reporting COIs before (84%; n  =  16) and during (95%; n  =  18) the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of practising open science. However, requirements for open science practices in audited policies were overall low, which may impede progress in health and medical research. As key stakeholders in disseminating research, journals should promote a research culture of greater transparency and more robust open science practices.",

        "Abstract": "Background and objective Patients with suspected malignant biliary strictures frequently undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-based brush cytology and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for establishing the diagnosis. The outcomes of these tests aid in the further management of the patient. A comparison of these two modalities in establishing the diagnosis is seldom reported. In light of this, we aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy between ERCP-based brush cytology and EUS-FNA for tissue diagnosis in malignant biliary obstruction. Our study involved a retrospective audit of all patients admitted to the Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre for EUS and ERCP from 2015 to 2019. Methodology A Comparative study was conducted in the Department of Medical Gastroenterology at the Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre over a five-year period. A total of 77 subjects who presented during the study period with biliary obstruction based on clinical presentation with altered liver function test in an obstructive pattern and evidence of biliary obstruction in the form of stricture or pancreaticobiliary mass on cross-sectional imaging were included in the study. All the patients included in the study underwent EUS and ERCP. Results The majority of the patients in the study were in the fifth decade of life with a slight female predominance. The most common CT finding was a periampullary mass with common bile duct (CBD) stricture (59.7%). In the study, EUS-FNA was more sensitive than ERCP-based tissue sampling. The overall sensitivity was 90.63% for EUS-FNA and 65.63% for ERCP sampling. EUS-FNA was found to have diagnostic accuracy of 92.63% in comparison to 71.43% for brush cytology. Conclusions Based on our findings, EUS-FNA is superior to ERCP-based tissue sampling with excellent sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. Performing EUS before ERCP in all patients with suspected malignant biliary obstruction would definitely improve diagnostic accuracy and thereby help in the management of such cases.",

        "Abstract": "Strongyloidiasis is caused by the intestinal roundworm, <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>, which has the potential for fatal outcome. It may present with vague gastrointestinal symptoms and mimic gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, and as such, it should be in the purview of the gastroenterologist. While strongyloidiasis is generally asymptomatic or produces mild symptoms in patients with an intact immune system, individuals who are immunocompromised may develop life-threatening disease through hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated disease. The worm has a complex lifecycle and is able to autoinfect its host, thereby allowing indefinite persistence even decades after initial infection. This leads to cases where travelers, and those who lived in endemic countries, may present years after travel. With its features of prolonged infection, relatively high global prevalence, and potential for fatal outcomes, it is imperative for all clinicians to be aware of this disease. Owing to its involvement with the gastrointestinal system, however, we will outline salient points about strongyloidiasis for the gastroenterologist.",

        "Abstract": "Women have historically been underrepresented in gastroenterology (GI). Currently they compose only a small percentage of practicing GI physicians in the United States. Despite the rise in women graduating medical school, the percentage of current female GI fellows has remained low in recent years. In this study, we sought to examine the trends of female representation in GI over the past 10 years, to further elucidate the disparity, and to illustrate if any major changes have occurred. The findings were compared to those for other specialties to shed light on the relationship between them. This retrospective study used data on the gender of residents obtained through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books from 2009-2019. Chi-square statistical testing was used to compare representation percentages across groups. Significance was determined at the P<0.05 level, while P<0.01 was also reported. Over a 10-year period from 2009-2019, an average of 33.6% of GI fellowship positions were filled by women, an increase of only 3.3% since 2009. Chi-square analysis of proportions across groups demonstrated a significantly lower percentage of female representation in GI in comparison to other specialties. Despite an increase in the number of women entering and graduating from medical school within the last decade, the number of female gastroenterologists remains a poor reflection of it. GI continues to have a significantly lower female representation than other specialties over the last decade.",

        "Abstract": "<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is one of the most pathogenic organisms that cause gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in humans. The main aim of this study was to determine the <i>H. pylori</i> infection among patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy and to compare the efficacy of the diagnostic method of <i>H. pylori</i> infection including invasive tests (biopsy-based tests like the rapid urease test (RUT), direct smear, and culture) and the noninvasive test (HpSA). A total of 100 stool samples and 200 gastric biopsy specimens were collected (2 samples from each patient) from June to November 2019. Stool samples were processed for the detection of an <i>H. pylori</i> stool antigen (HpSA) by a kit method. One biopsy specimen was processed for the RUT, and another was transported to the laboratory in an Eppendorf tube containing normal saline for preparation of the smear and culture. Out of 100 participants, 26% were found to be <i>H. pylori</i> positive by the RUT, 11% by the direct smear, 6% by the culture, and 17% by the stool antigen test. The prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection was found to be 14%, considering at least two of the three biopsy-based tests that gave positive results. <i>H. pylori</i> infection was found to be higher in the age group of 46-55 years. The overall prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection was higher in gastric ulcer cases, followed by erosive pangastritis and gastroduodenitis. Tea drinking habits and the frequency of meal consumption more than twice a day were found to be significantly associated with <i>H. pylori</i> infection (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Hence, the RUT was found to be more efficient than the direct smear and the culture method for finding <i>H. pylori</i> in the biopsy sample. However, none of these methods can be considered to be the gold standard alone. Thus, the RUT combined with other tests is preferable for the detection of <i>H. pylori</i>.",

        "Abstract": "The world's population is aging rapidly, with 40% of patients seen in US gastroenterology (GI) clinics being 60 years or older. Many gastrointestinal problems are more common or unique to the older adult because of progressive damage to the structure and function of the GI tract. Until recently, the epidemiology of disorders of gut-brain interaction (such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia) was not well-characterized. Forty percent of persons worldwide have disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), with varying global patterns of incidence in older adults. There are multiple first-line approaches to managing DGBI which can also be combined including pharmacologic (e.g., neuromodulators) and nonpharmacologic approaches including dietary therapies and brain-gut behavioral therapies. However, there are considerations clinicians must account for when offering each approach related to unique biopsychosocial factors in the older adult population. In this review, we aim to critically review recent literature on the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and special considerations for diagnosing and managing DGBI in the older adult population. There have been many advances in the management of DGBI over the past decades. Given the increase in the number of older adults in the USA and worldwide, there is an urgent need for evidence-based guidance to help providers guide comprehensive care for specifically our aging patient population with respect to DGBI.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds considerable promise for diagnostics in the field of gastroenterology. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI models compared with the gold standard of experts and histopathology for the diagnosis of various gastrointestinal (GI) luminal pathologies including polyps, neoplasms, and inflammatory bowel disease. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Wiley Cochrane Library, and Web of Science electronic databases to identify studies assessing the diagnostic performance of AI models for GI luminal pathologies. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. We performed a meta-analysis and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves (HSROC). The risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the type of GI luminal disease, AI model, reference standard, and type of data used for analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021288360). We included 73 studies, of which 31 were externally validated and provided sufficient information for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity of AI for detecting GI luminal pathologies was 91.9% (95% CI: 89.0-94.1) and specificity was 91.7% (95% CI: 87.4-94.7). Deep learning models (sensitivity: 89.8%, specificity: 91.9%) and ensemble methods (sensitivity: 95.4%, specificity: 90.9%) were the most commonly used models in the included studies. Majority of studies (<i>n</i> = 56, 76.7%) had a high risk of selection bias while 74% (<i>n</i> = 54) studies were low risk on reference standard and 67% (<i>n</i> = 49) were low risk for flow and timing bias. The review suggests high sensitivity and specificity of AI models for the detection of GI luminal pathologies. There is a need for large, multi-center trials in both high income countries and low- and middle- income countries to assess the performance of these AI models in real clinical settings and its impact on diagnosis and prognosis.

        "Abstract": "Pancreatitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in gastroenterology, and no medications are available for treating this disease in current clinical practice. FXR plays an anti-inflammatory role in diverse inflammatory diseases, while its function in pancreatitis remains unknown. In this study, we initially observed a marked increase of nuclear FXR in pancreatic tissues of human patients with pancreatitis. Deleting the FXR in pancreatic acinar cells (FXR<sup>acinar<i>Δ</i>/<i>Δ</i></sup> ) led to more severe pancreatitis in mouse models of caerulein-induced acute and chronic pancreatitis, while the FXR agonist GW4064 significantly attenuated pancreatitis in caerulein or arginine-induced acute pancreatitis and caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis. FXR deletion impaired the viability and stress responses of pancreatic exocrine organoids (PEOs) in vitro. Utilizing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq of PEOs, we identified <i>Osgin</i>1 as a direct target of FXR in the exocrine pancreas, which was also increasingly expressed in human pancreatitis tissues compared to normal pancreatic tissues. Pancreatic knockdown of <i>Osgin</i>1 by AAV-pan abolished the therapeutic effects of FXR activation on pancreatitis, whereas pancreatic overexpression of <i>Osgin</i>1 effectively alleviated caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Mechanistically, we found that the FXR-OSGIN1 axis stimulated autophagic flux in the pancreatic tissues and cell lines, which was considered as the intrinsic mechanisms through which FXR-OSGIN1 protecting against pancreatitis. Our results highlight the protective role of the FXR-OSGIN1 axis in pancreatitis and provided a new target for the treatment of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Collaboration between Primary Care (PC) and Gastroenterology in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is crucial to provide high-quality healthcare. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between PC and gastroenterologists at a national level in order to identify areas for improvement in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and how to address them, with the aim of subsequently developing concrete proposals and projects between SEMERGEN and GETECCU. Descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study, was carried out using an anonymous online questionnaire between October 2021 and March 2022. A total of 157 surveys from Gastroenterology and 222 from PC were collected. 43.8% and 34.3% of gastroenterologists and family practitioners, respectively, considered that there was a good relationship between the units. The level of knowledge from family practitioners regarding different aspects of IBD out of 10 was: clinical 6.67±1.48, diagnosis 6.47±1.46, treatment 5.63±1.51, follow-up 5.53±1.68 and complications 6.05±1.54. The perception of support between both units did not exceed 4.5 on a scale from 0 to 10 in either of the surveys. The most highly voted improvement proposals were better coordination between the units, implementation of IBD units, and nursing collaboration. There are deficiencies in the relationship between PC and Gastroenterology with special dedication to IBD that require the efforts of the scientific societies that represent them for greater coordination with the development of joint protocols and agile, fast, and effective communication channels.",

        "Abstract": "To prevent duodenal and ampullary cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, a diagnosis of high grade dysplasia (HGD) plays an important role in the clinical management. Previous research showed that FAP patients are both over- and undertreated after a misdiagnosis of HGD, indicating unwarranted variation. We aimed to investigate the laboratory variation in dysplasia grading of duodenal adenomas and explore possible explanations for this variation. We included data from all Dutch pathology laboratories between 1991 and 2020 by retrieving histology reports from upper endoscopy specimens of FAP patients from the Dutch nationwide pathology databank (PALGA). Laboratory variation was investigated by comparing standardized proportions of HGD. To describe the degree of variation between the laboratories a factor score was calculated. A funnel plot was used to identify outliers. A total of 3050 specimens from 25 laboratories were included in the final analyses. The mean observed HGD proportion was 9.4%. The top three HGD-diagnosing laboratories diagnosed HGD 3.9 times more often than the lowest three laboratories, even after correcting for case-mix. No outliers were identified. Moderate laboratory variation was found in HGD diagnoses of duodenal tissue of FAP patients after adjusting for case-mix. Despite the fact that no outliers were observed, there may well be room for quality improvement. Concentration of these patients in expertise centers may decrease variation. To further reduce unwarranted variation, we recommend (inter)national guidelines to become more uniform in their recommendations regarding duodenal tissue sampling and consequences of HGD diagnoses.",

The aims of this study were to: develop an evidence-based AIEP management algorithm; study its short-term and long-term impact on physician knowledge; and evaluate physician knowledge using hypothetical clinical scenarios. <b>Methods </b> An institutional AIEP management algorithm was created using the most current recommendations from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Input from advanced endoscopists, nurses, and anesthesiologists was also obtained. We assessed change in physician knowledge using a 10-item questionnaire before (pretest), a standardized one-page AIEP educational material and algorithm immediately after (post-test) to test short-term retention, and 6 months later (6-month reassessment) to test long-term retention. With the 6-month reassessment, two clinical scenarios based on real AIEP were presented to evaluate application of knowledge. <b>Results </b> Twenty-eight subjects (8 gastroenterology fellows and 20 practicing gastroenterologists) participated in the assessments. Pretest and immediate post-test accuracies were 75 % and 95 % ( <i>P</i>  < 0.01), respectively. Six-month reassessment accuracies were 83.6 %, significantly worse compared to post-test accuracies ( <i>P</i>  < 0.05), but significantly improved compared to pretest accuracies ( <i>P</i>  < 0.05). Accuracies for clinical scenarios #1 and #2 were 67.5 % and 60.3 %, respectively. Fellows had similar accuracies when compared to practicing gastroenterologists. <b>Conclusions </b> Using standardized methodology and a multidisciplinary approach, an AIEP management algorithm was created to improve patient care and alleviate physician and staff stress. In addition, we showed that a one-page educational document on perforations can significantly improve short-term and long-term physician knowledge, although periodic reeducation is needed.",

        "Abstract": "Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a typical medical emergency, with an incidence of 84 to 160 cases per 100,000 individuals and a mortality rate of approximately 10%. This study aimed to identify all cases of UGIB hospitalized in a tertiary gastroenterology department, to identify possible predictive factors involved in rebleeding and mortality, potential associations between different elements and the severity of bleeding, and the differences between the upper digestive hemorrhage due to nonvariceal and variceal bleeding. This was an observational, retrospective study of patients with UGIB admitted to the tertiary Department of Gastroenterology between January 2013 and December 2020. A total of 1499 patients were enrolled in the study. One thousand four hundred and ninety-nine patients were hospitalized for 7 years with active upper digestive hemorrhage, 504 variceal bleeding, and 995 nonvariceal bleeding. When comparing variceal with nonvariceal bleeding, in nonvariceal bleeding, the mean age was higher, similar sex, higher mortality rate, higher rebleeding rate, and higher hemorrhagic shock rate. Endoscopy treatment was also performed more frequently in variceal bleeding than in nonvariceal bleeding. Severe anemia was found more frequently in patients with variceal bleeding. The mortality rate was 10% in the entire study group, which was not significantly different between the 2 batches. However, the rebleeding rate is higher in patients with variceal gastrointestinal bleeding.",

        "Abstract": "Among renal transplant recipients, renal cell carcinoma in the native kidneys represents the most common solid tumor. At the Department of Surgery, Transplantation and Gastroenterology of Semmelweis University annual control abdominal ultrasound examination is recommended for transplant patients. Our goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of the ultrasound screening program at our institute and to learn about the characteristics of shrunken kidney tumors. Retrospectively, we processed the results of abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations of 1687 kidney transplant patients, which were performed at our institute between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. A total of 26 tumors were detected during the abovementioned period of time, of which 18 were renal cancers. Renal cancer was significantly (P = 0.029) more common in men. Seventeen renal cancers were classified as stage I and one as stage IV disease. The mean time of dialysis was 37.73 ± 24.37 months. The mean time between kidney transplantation and tumor recognition was 7.9 ± 6.29 years. The 5-year survival was 66%; however, it should be noted that only 1 patient lost his life due to his tumor disease. The mean time between the last 2 ultrasound examinations was 27.8 ± 23.89 months. Only 57% of tumors were detected by screening. No significant differences in tumor size, stage, and survival could be detected between screened and nonscreened renal cancer patients. Ultrasound examination at least every 2 years is an effective tool for the early detection of renal cell carcinoma of the shrunken kidneys.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health problem in the pediatric population, due to the constantly increasing percentage of children with obesity. The objective of the study was to assess the occurrence of NAFLD based on ultrasound (USG) analysis and the use of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in children with overweight and obesity depending on glucose tolerance. Medical records of 228 consecutive patients aged 2-18 years with overweight and obesity were reviewed retrospectively. Based on the oral glucose tolerance test children were divided into groups according to the severity of carbohydrate metabolism disorders. ALT, lipid parameters and insulin sensitivity indices HOMA, Matsuda and Quicki were analyzed. NAFLD was diagnosed (based on the USG) in 51 patients (23.61%) - the incidence in the impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) group was significantly higher when compared to ones without glucose intolerance. Because of extreme values of metabolic parameters in TDM2 children being outliers, they were not considered in the statistical analysis of the study. 22 (11.58%) patients had elevated ALT values, of which 12 (54.55%) had hepatic steatosis features on ultrasound. 72.73% (n=32) patients with fatty liver features on USG had ALT values considered normal with cut-off point 42 U/l accepted in this study. Almost every fourth obese child in the study group presents features of fatty liver in ultrasound examination. Although ultrasound is not recommended by North American <i>Society</i> For Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology &Nutrition(NASPGHAN) for the diagnosis of NAFLD in children, it allows identifying a high percentage of children with features of fatty liver. This percentage increases significantly in children with glucose intolerance.",

        "Title": "Effects of hydromorphone-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with and without a low basal infusion on postoperative hypoxaemia: study protocol for a randomised controlled clinical trial.",
        "Abstract": "When patients receive patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), no basal infusion is always recommended, as the addition of a basal infusion increases the occurrence of postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, few studies have investigated whether low basal infusions increase the incidence of postoperative hypoxaemia relative to no basal infusion. We intend to conduct a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that PCIA with a low basal infusion does not increase the occurrence of postoperative hypoxaemia relative to PCIA with no basal infusion. This single-centre parallel randomised controlled clinical trial will be conducted with 160 patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumour surgery. The assigned nurse will set analgesic pumps (low or no basal infusion PCIA) according to block-based randomisation sequence. Other investigators and all participants will be blinded to intervention allocation. All patients will be monitored continuously with the ep pod, a wireless wearable device, recording of oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and daily ambulation duration for 48 hours postoperatively. Three follow-up evaluations will be conducted to assess the analgesic effect (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score) and opioid-related side effects (Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS)). The primary outcome will be the area under the curve for hypoxaemia (defined as SpO<sub>2</sub><95%) per hour. The secondary outcomes will be the areas under the curve for hypoxaemia defined as SpO<sub>2</sub><90% and <85% per hour, hydromorphone consumption, OBASs at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, NRS scores at 4, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, and the ambulation time per hour over 48 hours. The study has been approved by the Xijing Hospital Ethics Committee (KY20212163-F-1). Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients or their authorised surrogates. All data will be managed with confidentiality. Findings will be disseminated at international conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. ChiCTR2100054317.",

APS is mostly associated with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and rarely reported in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. We herein report a case of APS as an initial presentation of double-seropositive aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies. The patient fulfilled the NMOSD diagnostic criteria. Brain MRI, CSF studies, electrophysiologic test, and serum NMO and MOG antibody testing were performed. An elderly woman initially presented to a gastroenterology outpatient department with a history of nausea, vomiting, and hiccups for 3 weeks. A detailed medical evaluation, including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, was performed, which showed normal findings with no improvement with symptomatic therapy. A neurologic examination showed bilateral nystagmus, postural imbalance, and gait ataxia. An MRI examination of the brain showed T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the dorsal medulla involving area postrema. Both anti-NMO and anti-MOG antibodies were found to be positive in serum. She was treated with intravenous methyl prednisolone with complete symptomatic resolution. Double-seropositive APS-onset NMOSD has not been previously reported in literature. An early diagnosis and treatment result in the resolution of APS-related symptoms and prevent further progression of the disease.",

        "Title": "A Correlation Between the Pathogenic Processes of Fibromyalgia and Irritable Bowel Syndrome in the Middle-Aged Population: A Systematic Review.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common pathology in middle-aged patients and a regular consultation in the gastroenterology office. The prevalence is high in females with a ratio of 2:1, and due to its multifactorial etiology, it is difficult to address the symptomatology. On the other hand, fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic widespread pain syndrome also prevalent in the female population, characterized by systemic symptoms. It is proven that 28-59 % of patients with FMS develop IBS at some point in their illness; on the other hand, 32-77% of those with IBS will develop FMS. Our study aims to compile information about the pathogenesis of these diseases and highlight their common processes to target these two illnesses potentially.  This systematic review comprises twenty-three studies published between 2017 and 2022, selected by electronic research with keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MESH) strategy. The articles were taken from PubMed, Pubmed Central (PMC), Medline, and Cochrane libraries and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the pertinent quality checklists. Of the reviewed studies, 10 were case-control, six were narrative reviews, three were systematic reviews, three were cross-sectional, and one was a cohort study. They investigated the correlation and similitudes in the pathogenic process between FMS and IBS. There are some similar mechanisms in the physiopathologies of IBS and FMS, where the immune system, especially the mast cells (MCs), along with their products, receptors, the inflammatory cells with their intermediaries, hormones, and neurotransmitters such as serotonin, act together pathologically. Also, the role of the microbiota is very important in this pathogenesis since dysbiosis alters the levels of serotonin in the body and can produce hyperstimulation of the autonomic nervous system. There are common associated factors in IBS and FMS, with evident symptoms presented in both syndromes such as fatigue, pain, hypersensitivity, depression, anxiety, and others, that could be correlated in a certain way. After this systematic review, we can conclude that the most accepted theories of the common pathogenesis are the role of serotonin and MCs with their inflammatory biomarkers, which can affect different parts of the body producing the characteristic symptomatology. Moreover, other pathogenic mechanisms such as the involvement of microbiota and dysregulation of the gut-brain axis have shown promising results, and further investigation should be made to support their role.",

        "Abstract": "Splenic artery aneurysm is one of the most common visceral aneurysms. Patients are usually asymptomatic. Splenic artery aneurysm if untreated has the potential for rupture and is therefore life-threatening. Its association with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is rare. A 25-year female was incidentally diagnosed with a splenic artery aneurysm with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction with splenomegaly 8 years back during the 5th month of her second pregnancy. No intervention was done back then. Recently, she presented to the surgical gastroenterology outpatient department with an increasing abdominal mass. On examination, the patient was pale and splenomegaly was present. Hematological reports were suggestive of hypersplenism. The patient underwent splenectomy and aneurysmal resection with a proximal splenorenal shunt as the best course of treatment. Due to the rarity of the disease, the management is still challenging and needs further study. Diagnosis can be made clinically with support from imaging modalities. Surgical treatment has a good outcome in such patients. Even with the availability of less invasive procedures such as endovascular treatment, open surgery is preferred. Proximal splenorenal shunt is a well-accepted surgical procedure for extrahepatic portal vein obstruction. Splenectomy and aneurysmal resection can relieve hypersplenism and treat splenic artery aneurysm in patients with isolated splenic artery aneurysm at the splenic hilum.",

        "Title": "Expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine 7 receptor in intestinal mucosa correlates with the degree of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a complex and heterogeneous disease characterized by nonspecific transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. CD has a variety of potential causes with no effective treatment available yet. Current clinical laboratory findings from patients do not provide direct indication of the status of mucosal inflammation in the intestine. Recently, it has been found that intestinal inflammation is generally associated with increased levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), which acts as an important gastrointestinal signaling molecule in intestinal homeostasis by stimulating specific receptors. Most previous researches were carried out in vitro or with animal models, and there was a lack of authentic clinical research. In this study, clinical specimens from patients with Crohn's disease were used to investigate the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine 7 receptor (5-HT7R) in the induction and development of chronic non-specific inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with CD admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between June 2014 and January 2018 were recruited, among which 28 were in active disease and 32 were in remission. In addition, 20 patients who had no obvious abnormality by colonoscopy in the hospital during the same time period were recruited into the control group. Data of clinical disease activity (CDAI), CD endoscopic score (SES-CD) and magnetic resonance score (MaRIA) were collected from those two groups of patients. The expression and distribution of 5-HT7R were investigated and their correlations with clinical CDAI, MaRIA, and endoscopic SES-CD scores were analyzed. Our study demonstrated that 5-HT7R is expressed in intestinal neurons and CD11<sub>C</sub>-positive cells in human colon. In CD11c/CD86 double-positive cells in the bowel, 5-HT7R expression was significantly increased in the inflammatory area in the bowel of CD patients, and it was closely related to disease severity, MaRIA, and SES-CD scores. The expression of 5-HT7R was significantly correlated with the degree of gut inflammation in CD patients and could be a potential biomarker for disease activity and the therapeutic efficacy in patients with Crohn's Disease.",

        "Abstract": "Trans-hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a treatment option for liver cancer patients. It can prolong patients' survival but can also cause symptom distress. Symptom distress (SDs) can directly impact quality of life (QOL) and may indirectly influence QOL by lessening hope. In this study, we wanted to explore the mediating effect of hope on the relationship between SDs and QOL among patients with liver cancer receiving TACE. A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 20, 2017, to August 6, 2018, at a gastroenterology ward of a medical center. The participants were 92 liver cancer patients (69.6% male, mean age 67.8) who were admitted for TACE treatment. Information on SDs, hope, and QOL was collected by questionnaire on discharge day. Hayes' PROCESS model was used to test the mediating effect of hope on the relationship between SDs and QOL. The mean score and standard deviation (SD) of SDs, hope, and QOL were 32.08 (SD = 6.22), 27.09 (SD = 3.51), and 55.16 (SD = 17.33), respectively. SDs negatively impacts quality of life. The total effect of SDs on QOL was - 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI]: - 1.96, - 0.86). The indirect effect via the mediation of hope was - 0.95 (95% CI: - 1.7, - 0.45). Hope partially mediated the effect of SDs on QOL. SDs after TACE is vital; it directly reduces a patient's overall QOL and can indirectly hinder it by reducing the patient's hope. In addition to symptom management, interventions that help patients maintain their hope are key to improving QOL among patients receiving TACE.",

        "Abstract": "Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains a major contributor to preterm mortality and morbidity. Prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy after delivery is associated with later NEC development but recent evidence suggests that absence of antibiotic treatment after delivery may also increase NEC risk. We will explore this controversy using a large pre-existing dataset of preterm infants in the UK. This is a retrospective cohort study using data from UK National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) for infants born 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2020. Eligible infants will be &lt;32 weeks gestation, alive on day 3. Primary outcome is development of severe NEC, compared in infants receiving early antibiotics (days 1-2 after birth) and those not. Subgroup analysis on duration of early antibiotic exposure will also occur. Secondary outcomes are: late onset sepsis, total antibiotic use, predischarge mortality, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular haemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, focal intestinal perforation and any abdominal surgery. To address competing risks, incidence of death before day 7, 14 and 28 will be analysed. We will perform logistic regression and propensity score matched analyses. Statistical analyses will be guided by NEC risk factors, exposures and outcome presented in a causal diagram. These covariates include but are not limited to gestational age, birth weight, small for gestational age, sex, ethnicity, delivery mode, delivery without labour, Apgar score, early feeding and probiotic use. Sensitivity analyses of alternate NEC definitions, specific antibiotics and time of initiation will occur. We will use deidentified data from NNRD, which holds permissions for the original data, from which parents can opt out and seek study-specific research ethics approval. The results will help to determine optimal use of early antibiotics for very preterm infants. This data will help optimise early antibiotic use in preterm infants. ISRCTN55101779.",

        "Title": "Crohn's disease shared decision making intervention leads to more patients choosing combination therapy: a cluster randomised controlled trial.",
        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease requires effective patient-clinician communication for successful illness and medication management. Shared decision making (SDM) has been suggested to improve communication around early intensive therapy. However, effective evidence-based SDM interventions for Crohn's disease are lacking, and the impact of SDM on Crohn's disease decision making and choice of therapy is unclear. To test the impact of SDM on choice of therapy, quality of the decision and provider trust compared to standard Crohn's disease care. We conducted a multi-site cluster randomised controlled trial in 14 diverse gastroenterology practices in the US. A total of 158 adult patients with Crohn's disease within 15 years of their diagnosis, with no prior Crohn's disease complications, and who were candidates to receive immunomodulators or biologics, participated in the study. Among these, 99 received the intervention and 59 received standard care. Demographics were similar between groups, although there were more women assigned to standard care, and a slightly shorter disease duration among those in the intervention group. Participants in the intervention group more frequently chose combination therapy (25% versus 5% control, p < 0.001), had a significantly lower decisional conflict (p < 0.05) and had greater trust in their provider (p < 0.05). With rapidly expanding medication choices for Crohn's disease and slow uptake of early intensive therapy, SDM can personalise treatment strategies and has the potential to move the field of Crohn's disease management forward with an ultimate goal of consistently treating this disease early and intensively in appropriate patients.

        "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is infecting 50 percent or more of the world's population, putting it the most ubiquitous infection on the world. This study is done with the objective to determine the frequency and risk factors of Helicobacter pylori infection among dyspepsia patients at Patel Hospital Karachi. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the gastroenterology department at the Patel Hospital in Karachi from 10th Jan to 10th July 2021. All patients with dyspepsia for at least 6 months having age 20-60 years of either gender were included. Three samples from stomach (2 from antrum,1 from corpus) for biopsies were collected from each patient. The specimen was sent to the microbiology department of the hospital and was reported as having histopathological confirmation of Helicobacter pylori infection. Of 111 patients with dyspepsia, mean age of the patients was 44.19±16.41 years. Most of the patients (n=65, 58.6%) were males and 46 (41.4%) were females. The mean duration of dyspepsia was 11.48±5.53 months. Helicobacter pylori was discovered to be present in 93 percent of individuals (83.8 percent). The odds of Helicobacter pylori infection were found to be 7.99 times higher among patients over 40 years old (AOR: 7.99, 95 percent CI: 2.02-31.64, p: 0.003), 3.93 times higher among patients with >9 months of dyspepsia (AOR: 3.93, 95 percent CI: 1.09-14.16, p: 0.036), and 11.85 times higher among smokers as compared to non-smokers (AOR: 11.85, 95 percent CI: 1.42-99.08, p-value 0.023). The rate of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with dyspepsia was found to be higher. Furthermore, increasing age, increase duration of dyspepsia and smoking is found to be independent risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "The perioperative chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin plus docetaxel (FLOT) was recommended by the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines for gastric cancer (2018 edition) for patients with resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (class IIA). However, the economic impact of FLOT chemotherapy in China remains unclear. The analysis aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of FLOT versus epirubicin, cisplatin plus fluorouracil or capecitabine (ECF/ECX) in patients with locally advanced resectable tumours. We developed a Markov model to compare the healthcare and economic outcomes of FLOT and ECF/ECX in patients with resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Costs were estimated from the perspective of Chinese healthcare system. Clinical and utility inputs were derived from the FLOT4 phase II/III clinical trial and published literature. Sensitivity analyses were employed to assess the robustness of our result. The annual discount rate for costs and health outcomes was set at 5%. The primary outcome of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) was calculated as the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The base-case analysis found that compared with ECF/ECX, the use of FLOT chemotherapy was associated with an additional 1.08 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of US$851/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis results suggested that the HR of overall survival and progression-free survival had the greatest impact on the ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that FLOT was more likely to be cost-effective compared with ECF/ECX at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$31 513/QALY. For patients with locally advanced resectable tumours, the FLOT chemotherapy is a cost-effective treatment option compared with ECF/ECX in China. NCT01216644.",

        "Abstract": "To describe characteristics of service utilization by advanced practice nurses (APNs) employing an electronic consultation (eConsult) service in their care for older adults. Canada's aging population is projected to place unprecedented demands on the healthcare system. APNs, which include clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) and nurse practitioners (NPs), are nurses with advanced knowledge who can independently provide age-appropriate care. eConsult is a secure web-based platform enabling asynchronous, provider-to-provider communication. APNs can send and receive eConsults to address patient-specific concerns. This is a retrospective analysis of eConsult utilization and user survey data for cases completed in 2019, reported in line with the STROBE guidelines. Eligible eConsults included those that had APN involvement (as a referrer or responder) and were concerning an older patient (≥65 years). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse service utilization and survey response data. Of 430 eligible eConsults, 421 (97.9%) were initiated by NPs and the rest by physicians. 23 (5.3%) were received by a CNS, of which 14 (3.3%) involved an NP-to-CNS exchange. Median specialist response interval was 0.9 days. 53% of eConsults was for dermatology, haematology, cardiology, gastroenterology and endocrinology. 73% of eConsults avoided a face-to-face referral after the consultation. In 90% of eConsults, APNs rated the service as helpful and/or educational. Through eConsult, APNs can collaborate with each other and physicians to access and provide a breadth of advice facilitating timely specialist-informed care for older patients, thus helping to alleviate some of the demands placed on the healthcare system. There is an opportunity for APNs to further adopt eConsult into their clinical practice, and this can, in turn, support the integration of the APN role in the health workforce. Current APN eConsult users were involved in the study design and interpretation of results.",

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed severe esophagitis with ulcerated mucosa, exudative debris, haemorrhage and multiple erosions. Biopsy of the oesophageal tissue demonstrated marginated chromatin, multinucleated giant cells and molding of nuclei, consistent with herpes simplex virus esophagitis (HSE). Treatment with oral acyclovir led to the complete resolution of symptoms. The patient subsequently developed dysphagia again, 8 months later. EGD showed furrowing and concentric rings typical of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a diagnosis confirmed by biopsy. Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor and swallowed topical corticosteroids led to symptomatic improvement. Thus, HSE can occur in immunocompetent hosts and on occasion, HSE may be a harbinger of EoE, as evidenced by our extensive literature review. Mechanical disruption of the mucosal barrier by viruses, facilitating food allergen penetration, and associated immunological signaling abnormalities may be responsible phenomena requiring further elucidation.",

        "Title": "European College of Equine Internal Medicine consensus statement on equine flaviviridae infections in Europe.",
        "Abstract": "Horses and other equids can be infected with several viruses of the family Flaviviridae, belonging to the genus Flavivirus and Hepacivirus. This consensus statement focuses on viruses with known occurrence in Europe, with the objective to summarize the current literature and formulate clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations regarding clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The viruses circulating in Europe include West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Usutu virus, Louping ill virus and the equine hepacivirus. West Nile virus and Usutu virus are mosquito-borne, while tick-borne encephalitis virus and Louping ill virus are tick-borne. The natural route of transmission for equine hepacivirus remains speculative. West Nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus can induce encephalitis in infected horses. In the British Isle, rare equine cases of encephalitis associated with Louping ill virus are reported. In contrast, equine hepacivirus infections are associated with mild acute hepatitis and possibly chronic hepatitis. Diagnosis of flavivirus infections is made primarily by serology, although cross-reactivity occurs. Virus neutralization testing is considered the gold standard to differentiate between flavivirus infections in horses. Hepacivirus infection is detected by serum or liver RT-PCR. No direct antiviral treatment against flavi- or hepacivirus infections in horses is currently available and thus, treatment is supportive. Three vaccines against West Nile virus are licensed in the European Union. Geographic expansion of flaviviruses pathogenic for equids should always be considered a realistic threat, and it would be beneficial if their detection was included in surveillance programs.",

        "Title": "Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders with Psychiatric Symptoms: Involvement of the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis in the Pathophysiology and Case Management.",
        "Abstract": "Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders have been an important cause of poor life quality in affected populations. The unclear etiology and pathophysiological mechanism alter the clinical evolution of the patient. Although a strong connection with psychological stress has been observed, it was not until recently that the gut-brain axis involvement has been revealed. Furthermore, the current literature not only promotes the gut-brain axis modulation as a therapeutical target for functional digestive disorders but also states that the gut microbiome has a main role in this bi-directional mechanism. Psychiatric symptoms are currently recognized as an equally important aspect of the clinical manifestation and modulation of both the digestive and central nervous systems and could be the best approach in restoring the balance. As such, this article proposes a detailed description of the physiology of the microbiome-gut-brain axis, the pathophysiology of the functional gastrointestinal disorders with psychiatric symptoms and current perspectives for therapeutical management, as revealed by the latest studies in the scientific literature.",

        "Abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-⍺) antagonists are biological drugs with multiple authorized biosimilars. Biosimilars are becoming critical to the financial sustainability of health systems. Recent studies emphasize that physicians' knowledge regarding biosimilars has not yet progressed sufficiently to overcome their concerns regarding biosimilars' safety and efficacy. To assess the current knowledge, opinions, and attitudes toward TNF-⍺ antagonist biosimilars among postgraduate physicians and specialists, an anonymous, self-administered survey was implemented on SurveyMonkey between February and May 2022. The survey was validated through think-aloud interviews with senior and postgraduate physicians in rheumatology, gastroenterology, and immunoallergology, and a senior epidemiologist. Participant recruitment was conducted with the help of the physicians' professional societies and departmental head physicians of two university hospitals in Western Switzerland. Most physicians felt more comfortable initiating a TNF-⍺ antagonist biosimilar in biologic-naive patients (BNPs) than switching patients stabilized on the original biologic (originator). However, most participants agreed that BNPs should start treatment with the biosimilar rather than the originator when available. Postgraduate physicians and specialists in rheumatology, gastroenterology, and immunoallergology who participated in this survey were familiar with TNF-⍺ antagonist biosimilars and were confident in prescribing them. Yet, they still preferred to avoid switching a patient already on the originator.",

        "Abstract": "To audit the quality of ethnicity data stored under National Health Index (NHI) in the Hutt Hospital database against a fresh collection of self-identified ethnicity to identify the level of (mis)match present between the datasets. Self-identified ethnicity data was collected from 200 consecutive patients presenting to outpatient gastroenterology services and compared to National Health Index (NHI) in the Hutt Hospital database, using the process outlined in the Primary Care Ethnicity Data Audit Toolkit. The overall level of match between the individual's self-identified ethnicity and that recorded in the hospital database was 89% (95% CI [83.8-93.0]). Eighteen patients (9%) self-identified as Māori, 16.7% (95% CI [3.6-41.4]) of whom were not recorded as Māori in the hospital database. Three patients were recorded as Māori in the hospital database but did not self-identify as Māori. Ethnicity data are fundamental to the monitoring and provision of equitable health and healthcare, with a range of applications in the health sector. Our findings of poor-quality ethnicity data for Māori in a hospital NHI database are consistent with previous studies. The assessment of ethnicity data quality must be done in multiple ways to reflect its multiple uses.",

        "Abstract": "Modern endoscopy relies on digital technology, from high-resolution imaging sensors and displays to electronics connecting configurable illumination and actuation systems for robotic articulation. In addition to enabling more effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the digitization of the procedural toolset enables video data capture of the internal human anatomy at unprecedented levels. Interventional video data encapsulate functional and structural information about a patient's anatomy as well as events, activity and action logs about the surgical process. This detailed but difficult-to-interpret record from endoscopic procedures can be linked to preoperative and postoperative records or patient imaging information. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence, especially in supervised deep learning, can utilize data from endoscopic procedures to develop systems for assisting procedures leading to computer-assisted interventions that can enable better navigation during procedures, automation of image interpretation and robotically assisted tool manipulation. In this Perspective, we summarize state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for computer-assisted interventions in gastroenterology and surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Eliminating mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is central to WHO's target of reducing hepatitis B infection in children to &lt;0.1% by 2030. While Nigeria accounts for 8.3% of the global burden, interventional studies on prevention of MTCT of HBV are hardly available. This study aimed to assess the impact of prevention of MTCT interventions on vertical transmission of HBV among pregnant women in Nigeria. A prospective cohort study. A University Teaching Hospitals Complex in Nigeria between 2015 and 2021. 10 866 pregnant women and their pre-existing children. Eligible pregnant women were screened for HBsAg using chromatographic immunoassay (Micropoint, USA). HbsAg-positive women had HBV serological assay done and their pre-existing children were screened. Women with HBV DNA ≥2 00 000 IU/mL and those positive for hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) had 300 mg/day of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) in the third trimester. The newborns had hepatitis B vaccines and HB immunoglobulin (HBIG) administered, followed by testing for HBsAg at 9 months postnatally. Prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in pregnancy, and the incidence of MTCT of HBV. Overall, 395 women had chronic HBV infection, giving a prevalence of 3.64%. Their mean age was 31.51±5.71 years, with a median parity of 1.2. Thirteen women (5.2%) were positive for HBeAg, seven (3.1%) of the 225 pre-existing hepatitis B-exposed children were HbsAg positive and 17 women had prenatal TDF. Overall, 376 women completed the study, with mean birth weight of 3.21±1.86 kg and perinatal mortality rate of 29.2/1000 births. Hepatitis Bvaccine-HBIG combination was administered to 260 newborns, while the others had hepatitis B vaccine alone. All the children tested negative to the HbsAg at 9 months. Eliminating MTCT of HBV infection through validated protocols in low and middle income countries with the highest burden of chronic HBV infections is feasible. National scale-up of such protocols is recommended.",

        "Abstract": "Textbooks covering normal human histology illustrate an allegedly normal gastric mucosa containing significant infiltrates of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. This standard description seems to conflict with the pathologist's criterion for normality, which specifies only a few or a complete absence of inflammatory cells. Eventually, both anatomists and pathologists face the dilemma: how much infiltrate should their students and medical colleagues be told is acceptable for the gastric mucosa to be classified as normal? Summarizing the suggestions of experts in gastroenterology and our own experience, a simple approach could be to accept no more than five mononuclear and plasma cells per high power field as normal (400-fold magnification with a field area of 0.24 mm<sup>2</sup> ). The divergence of views on this topic illustrates the need for anatomists and pathologists to find a consensus about the definition of \"normal\" tissues.",

        "Abstract": "The proper management of patients being treated with platelet aggregation inhibitors or anticoagulant drugs is a common clinical problem for both elective and emergency procedures in gastroenterology and visceral surgery. The essential matters that must be kept in mind in this situation are the hemorrhagic risk of the procedure, the indication for anticoagulation, and the pharmacology of anticoagulant drugs and platelet aggregation inhibitors. This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed and on the guidelines of the relevant specialist societies. Nearly all procedures in gastroenterology and visceral surgery can be performed under monotherapy with acetyl - salicylic acid. Other platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as clopidogrel or prasugrel, or anticoagulant drugs generally do not need to paused before diagnostic endoscopic procedures with a low risk of bleeding (<1.5%), but they must be paused before procedures in gastroenterology and visceral surgery where the risk of bleeding is high (≥ 1.5%). Bridging with heparin is reserved for patients with a very high risk of thromboembolism ( ≥ 5%). Knowledge of the current recommendations on the management of anticoagulants before gastroenterological and visceral surgical procedures gives the clinician a well-founded means of dealing with this complex and common clinical situation.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer-related death, often detected in the intermediate stage. The standard of care for intermediate-stage HCC is transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), where idarubicin (IDA) is a promising drug. Despite the fact that TACE has been used for several decades, treatment success is unpredictable. This clinical trial has been designed believing that further improvement might be achieved by increasing the understanding of interactions between local pharmacology, tumour targeting, HCC pathophysiology, metabolomics and molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. The study population of this single-centre clinical trial consists of adults with intermediate-stage HCC. Each tumour site will receive TACE with two different IDA doses, 10 and 15 mg, on separate occasions. Before and after each patient's first TACE blood samples, tissue and liquid biopsies, and positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI will be performed. Blood samples will be used for pharmacokinetics (PK) and liver function evaluation. Tissue biopsies will be used for histopathology analyses, and culturing of primary organoids of tumour and non-tumour tissue to measure cell viability, drug response, multiomics and gene expression. Multiomics analyses will also be performed on liquid biopsies. PET/MRI will be used to evaluate tumour viability and liver metabolism. The two doses of IDA will be compared regarding PK, antitumour effects and safety. Imaging, molecular biology and multiomics data will be used to identify HCC phenotypes and their relation to drug uptake and metabolism, treatment response and survival. Participants give informed consent. Personal data are deidentified. A patient will be withdrawn from the study if considered medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient.

PCT has high success and low complication rates, but there are still unresolved issues regarding the duration of the procedure. The aim of our study is to determine the characteristics and outcome of patients treated with short-term PCT drainage. Patients who were admitted to the Department of gastroenterology and the Department of Abdominal Surgery at the University Hospital Center Split under the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and who were treated with the PCT, in a period between January 2015 and January 2020, were retrospectively included in the study. During that timeframe we identified 92 patients and have analyzed their characteristics and clinical outcomes. The statistical analysis included the Kaplan-Meier method for calculating survival curves for grades 2 and 3, the log-rank test for testing the difference between survival rates of grade 2 and 3 patients, and logistic regression to determine variables that affected the outcome of our patients. According to the Tokyo guidelines, most of the patients (74, 80.43%) met the criteria for grade 2 cholecystitis, and the minority had grade 1 (9, 9.78%) and grade 3 (9, 9.78%) cholecystitis. The average drainage duration was 10.1 ± 4.8 (3-28) days. We identified mild complications in 6 cases. Nine patients (10%) had lethal outcome. The mortality in the largest group of patients with grade 2 cholecystitis was 5.48% and as high as 71.43% in patients with grade 3 cholecystitis. The complication rate was 6.5%. One quarter of gallbladder aspirates showed a ciprofloxacin resistance. Short-time PCT lasting approximately 10 days can be used safely and effectively for the treatment of patients with acute cholecystitis.",

This is a prospective multi-centric observational cohort study comprising of an oncology center, one university tertiary hospital with specialized hepatology service, one public hospital with gastroenterology service, and a private liver transplant center located within a 3-km radius. The demographic and clinical parameters were recorded on a prospectively maintained database. The clinical profile, demographics, characteristics of HCC and the allocated treatment were noted and compared among the four centers. In total, 672 patients were enrolled from June 2016 till January 2020. Abdominal pain (64.3%) and weight loss (47.3%) were the most common symptoms. Most common identified etiology was hepatitis B (39%). The cancer center received lesser patients with hepatitis C and those with advanced stage of HCC. The private transplant center reported the highest proportion of NASH, which was also significantly higher in those belonging to higher socioeconomic strata, and lowest proportion of alcoholic cirrhosis. Metastasis was seen in almost one-fifth (19%) cases at diagnosis. Portal vein thrombosis was evident in 40%. Adherence to treatment guidelines was seen in three-fourth cases (76%). Hepatitis B is the most common underlying cause for HCC, whereas other causes like NASH are on the rise. Etiologic profile may vary with selective specialization of centers catering to patients with HCC. Adherence to guideline while allocating treatment was high among all centers with highest non-adherence in BCLC A.",

This prevents correct interpretation of the disease burden. To assess the main clinical and epidemiological features of adult patients diagnosed with UC in Sardinia, Italy. We performed a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study that included adult patients with UC enrolled in seven gastroenterology unit centers in Sardinia. Data were obtained from the patients' medical records and from a questionnaire administered at the inclusion visit. Four hundred and forty-two patients with UC were included. The median age at diagnosis was 39 years (interquartile range 28-48). After a median disease duration of 10 years, 53 patients experienced proximal extension of proctitis or left-sided colitis. Seventy-five patients developed extraintestinal manifestations. Nineteen patients (4.3%) developed cancer: two with colorectal cancer and seventeen with extracolonic cancers. Mesalazine (5-ASA) remains the mainstay of treatment for UC. Overall, 95 patients (21.5%) were treated with one or more biologic agents, whereas 15 patients (3.4%) underwent surgery, mostly colectomy. Our results provide important insights into the clinical and epidemiological features of patients with UC, and while waiting for a national Italian registry, present eligible data on the UC population in Sardinia.",

        "Abstract": "For over 40 years, restorative proctocolectomy has been used in patients with ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis undergoing proctocolectomy. Radiologists are now encountering an increasing number of patients with an ileal pouch and therefore need to understand the clinical issues and concerns in these patients. This review is the introduction of a special issue on the ileal pouch and was written with both surgeon and gastroenterology input. The intent is to assist the radiologist in understanding the clinical questions posed by both the patients and their physicians. Subsequent sessions will address specific imaging modalities and techniques, how the gastroenterologists and surgeons address issues with these patients, and a final session summarizing the sessions and speculating on future investigations and approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Private equity investments in U.S. health care have become very common across more parts of our health care system than most physicians and other health professionals realize. The motivation in every case is to reap short-term profits for investors regardless of the consequences on patient care. These investments range from hospitals, emergency room services, and outpatient facilities to nursing homes and home care. Physician practices have been bought and sold in a number of specialties, including anesthesiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, obstetrics-gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, and radiology. After leveraged buyouts using borrowed money, the typical modus operandi of private equity is to load the acquired asset with debt, cut costs as a way to increase revenues, press for unnecessary procedures, then sell the asset typically in three to five years. This article describes that process, including the harmful impacts of private equity on health care, and summarizes what is being done to rein in the exploitive practices of private equity ownership.",

        "Abstract": "The EuroPedHp-registry aims to monitor guideline-conform management, antibiotic resistance, and eradication success of 2-week triple therapy tailored to antibiotic susceptibility (TTT) in Helicobacter pylori-infected children. From 2017 to 2020, 30 centres from 17 European countries reported anonymized demographic, clinical, antibiotic susceptibility, treatment, and follow-up data. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with treatment failure. Of 1605 patients, 873 had follow-up data (53.2% female, median age 13.0 years, 7.5% with ulcer), thereof 741 (85%) treatment naïve (group A) and 132 (15%) after failed therapy (group B). Resistance to metronidazole was present in 21% (A: 17.7%, B: 40.2%), clarithromycin in 28.8% (A: 25%, B: 51.4%), and both in 7.1% (A: 3.8%, B: 26.5%). The majority received 2-week tailored triple therapy combining proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin with clarithromycin (PAC) or metronidazole (PAM). Dosing was lower than recommended for PPI (A: 49%, B: 41%) and amoxicillin (A: 6%, B: 56%). In treatment naïve patients, eradication reached 90% (n = 503, 95% CI 87-93%) and 93% in compliant children (n = 447, 95% CI 90-95%). Tailored triple therapy cured 59% patients after failed therapy (n = 69, 95% CI 48-71%). Treatment failure was associated with PAM in single clarithromycin resistance (OR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.10-5.53), with PAC in single metronidazole resistance (OR = 3.44, 95% CI 1.47-8.08), and with low compliance (OR = 5.89, 95% CI 2.49-13.95). Guideline-conform 2-weeks therapy with PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole tailored to antibiotic susceptibility achieves primary eradication of ≥ 90%. Higher failure rates in single-resistant strains despite tailored treatment indicate missed resistance by sampling error.",

        "Abstract": "Strictures in Crohn's disease (CD) are a hallmark of long-standing intestinal damage, brought about by inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathways. Understanding the complex pathophysiology related to inflammatory infiltrates, extracellular matrix deposition, as well as muscular hyperplasia is crucial to produce high-quality scoring indices for assessing CD strictures. In addition, cross-sectional imaging modalities are the primary tool for diagnosis and follow-up of strictures, especially with the initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy clinical trials. This in turn requires such modalities to both diagnose strictures with high accuracy, as well as be able to delineate the impact of each histomorphologic component on the individual stricture. We discuss the current knowledge on cross-sectional imaging modalities used for stricturing CD, with an emphasis on histomorphologic correlates, novel imaging parameters which may improve segregation between inflammatory, muscular, and fibrotic stricture components, as well as a future outlook on the role of artificial intelligence in this field of gastroenterology.",

        "Abstract": "Most ingested foreign bodies often pass through the gastrointestinal tract uneventfully; however, complications such as perforation do occur. Jejunal perforation is a known complication of abdominal trauma. While gastrointestinal tract injury due to the ingested foreign body such as a toothpick, fishbone, and battery among others are common, jejunal perforation is not very common in pediatrics. We report an unusual case of jejunal perforation that was diagnosed after a child was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for nonfatal drowning. A 15-month-old girl presented to our emergency room after she was found submerged in a swimming pool. She was unwitnessed for about ten minutes. At the scene, she was apneic, and cyanotic but had a pulse. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and she was brought to our emergency room. She was managed for her drowning injuries and was accidentally found to have a foreign body on her abdomen by x-ray. She had no signs or symptoms of perforation, however, after questioning the parents they told us that they brought her a toy containing magnet balls about one month ago. After stabilizing her respiratory status and correcting her acidosis, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was done that showed jejunal perforation and multiple magnets. A consultation was done immediately for the pediatric surgery team then the perforation was repaired. High-powered magnets represent a serious health hazard if ingested due to risks of gastrointestinal perforation. It is important to have a high index of suspicion for potential injuries, especially silent ones. One of the rare complications is contained jejunal perforation.",

However, an overlap of symptom categories frequently occurs and has a negative impact on treatment outcomes. There is a lack of guidance on their management. An Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) working group was set up to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) who have an overlap with another functional gastrointestinal disorder: FD with gastroesophageal reflux (FD-GERD), epigastric pain syndrome with irritable bowel syndrome (EPS-IBS), postprandial distress syndrome with IBS (PDS-IBS), and FD-Constipation.

The Quality Certificate for Colorectal Cancer Screening-which was launched as a quality assurance program on a voluntary basis by the Austrian Society of Gastroenterology and Hepatology together with the umbrella organization of Austrian social insurance carriers and the Austrian Cancer Aid for endoscopists throughout Austria-monitors these quality parameters. The aim is to achieve the highest standards of colorectal cancer screening in order to achieve the best outcomes for patients.

        "Abstract": "Indigenous people in Canada often face barriers to access specialized care, with limited data in evaluating health care utilization among Indigenous people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to compare health care utilization between First Nations patients and those in the general population diagnosed with IBD in Saskatchewan. We conducted a patient-oriented, population-based, retrospective cohort study by linking administrative health databases of Saskatchewan between fiscal years 1998/99 and 2017/18. We designed and completed this study in partnership with Indigenous patients and family advocates. We applied a validated algorithm to identify IBD incident cases and then used the self-declared First Nations status variable to divide those cases. We applied a 1:5 ratio for age and sex matching and used Cox proportional models to assess associations. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. We created a matched cohort with 696 IBD incident cases: 116 First Nations patients and 580 patients in the general population. We observed differences between the groups for IBD-specific hospital admissions (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.75), IBD-related hospital admissions (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.20-2.01), medication claims for IBD (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41-0.65) and 5-aminosalicylic acid claims (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.71) adjusting by rural or urban residence and diagnosis type. There were no significant differences in the hazard rate of outpatient gastroenterology visits (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.90-1.41), colonoscopies (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.92-1.41) and surgeries for IBD (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.80-1.64). We identified that First Nations patients diagnosed with IBD had a higher rate of hospital admissions owing to IBD than patients in the general population diagnosed with IBD. We also found an inverse association between First Nations status and having prescription medication claims for IBD.",

The primary outcome was prevalence of advanced fibrosis in first-degree relatives.RESULTSPrevalence of advanced fibrosis in first-degree relatives of probands with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis, NAFLD without advanced fibrosis, and non-NAFLD was 15.6%, 5.9%, and 1.3%, respectively (P = 0.002), in the derivation cohort, and 14.0%, 2.6%, and 1.3%, respectively (P = 0.004), in the validation cohort. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, age of ≥50 years (adjusted OR [aOR]: 2.63, 95% CI 1.0-6.7), male sex (aOR: 3.79, 95% CI 1.6-9.2), diabetes mellitus (aOR: 3.37, 95% CI 1.3-9), and a first-degree relative with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis (aOR: 11.8, 95% CI 2.5-57) were significant predictors of presence of advanced fibrosis (all P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONFirst-degree relatives of probands with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis have significantly increased risk of advanced fibrosis. Routine screening should be done in the first-degree relatives of patients with advanced fibrosis.FUNDINGSupported by NCATS (5UL1TR001442), NIDDK (U01DK061734, U01DK130190, R01DK106419, R01DK121378, R01DK124318, P30DK120515, K23DK119460), NHLBI (P01HL147835), and NIAAA (U01AA029019); Academy of Finland grant 309263; the Novo Nordisk, EVO, and Sigrid Jusélius Foundations; and the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement 777377.

        "Abstract": "We aimed to determine the nutrient intake of Crohn's patients and to expose its relationship with Crohn's Activity Index (CDAI), Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and Body Mass Index (BMI). This randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients enrolled in the Gastroenterology Polyclinic of a University Medical Faculty Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey in 2017. Two groups were included in this study: Crohn's Group (n = 100) and Control (n = 89). Crohn's Disease Activity Index was used to detect disease activity. Malnutrition risk was determined by the SGA and daily energy and nutrient intakes were calculated. There was a significant relationship between SGA and both CDAI and BMI (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.008, respectively). Daily energy, carbohydrate, monosaccharide, starch, sucrose, fructose, poly-unsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, vitamin E and C, thiamine, niacin, pyridoxine, Mg, P, Fe, Cu, Zn intakes were significantly lower in Crohn's Group than in Control Group. While more than 50% of the patients did not consume enough, B6, C, thiamine, niacin, folic acid, Mg, Ca and fiber, intakes of vitamin E, riboflavin, Fe, P, and Zn were adequate. Energy and nutrient (vitamin E, thiamine, vitamin B6, mono and poly unsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, Mg, Ca, P, Zn, n-3 fatty acids and starch) intakes were negatively correlated with CDAI, but there was no relationship between these intakes and SGA. There was a relationship between CDAI, SGD and BMI used to determine nutritional status in patients with Crohn's.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic affected many people worldwide, including those with chronic diseases. Our objective was to analyze its influence on medical care and the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS In 2021, 81 patients in Poland with IBD completed an original anonymous questionnaire about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the course of their disease and mental status. The printed questionnaire was distributed to IBD patients treated at the Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic of the University Clinical Hospital in Białystok, and an online questionnaire was sent to patients via social media. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test, with a significance level of P<0.05. RESULTS The study group consisted of 46 women and 35 men with a mean age of 32.42 years. Fifty-nine patients had ulcerative colitis and 22 had Crohn disease. Patients reported significant deterioration in medication availability (50.62%) and restricted access to gastroenterology outpatient clinics (51.90%) (P<0.05). Of patients who contracted COVID-19, 89.47% did not require hospitalization, 32.10% (26/81) were asymptomatic, mild, or moderate, despite immunosuppressive biological treatment (27.16%, 22/81), or steroids (18.52%, 15/81). Over 50% of respondents stated the pandemic negatively affected their mental state and 30% of them associated that with worsening IBD. CONCLUSIONS During the pandemic, respondents were mainly concerned with difficulties in accessing the gastroenterology clinic and limited drug availability. The pandemic negatively affected patients' mental state. In cases of COVID-19 disease, patients with IBD were mostly asymptomatic and did not require hospitalization, despite therapy affecting the immune system.",

        "Abstract": "Absent contractility is a rare esophageal motility disorder defined by high-resolution manometry which remains poorly understood in pathogenesis and management. We investigated the clinical symptoms, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings, and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) characteristics in adult patients diagnosed with absent contractility on high resolution manometry and factors associated with erosive esophagitis that were found on endoscopy in these patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with absent contractility who were examined at the Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Vietnam between March 2018 and December 2020. Clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, and LES metrics were collected and compared between individuals with and without erosive esophagitis. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine a variety of factors associated with erosive esophagitis. Among 7519 patients who underwent high resolution manometry, 204 (2.7%) were diagnosed with absent contractility. The mean age of the study sample was 45.9 years, 65.7% were women, and none had systemic sclerosis. The most common symptoms were regurgitation, belching, epigastric pain, and bloating. On endoscopy, 50% had erosive esophagitis, mostly Los Angeles grade A (42.9%). On manometry, 44.6% of the patients had LES hypotension and 68.1% had low integrated relaxation pressure in 4 seconds (IRP4s). Male sex (adjusted odds ratio = 2.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.89) and an IRP4s < 5 mm Hg (adjusted odds ratio = 2.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-4.37) were significantly associated with erosive esophagitis. Absent contractility was present in many patients without known systemic diseases. Erosive esophagitis was common and associated with male sex and low IRP4s.",

        "Abstract": "Simultaneous occurrence of immune-based gastrointestinal diseases and autoimmune hepatitis, although not common, is of clinical importance. Some clinical and laboratory findings such as severe pruritus and elevated alkaline phosphatase raise suspicion of a biliary disease which overlaps autoimmune hepatitis. A strong clinical suspicion of overlap syndrome in a patient with autoimmune hepatitis prompts more diagnostic evaluations like MRCP, liver biopsy, and secondary laboratory tests. Patients who fall into the category of overlap syndrome proceed with timely monitoring of known complications including colorectal carcinomas, cholangiocarcinomas, and gallbladder cancers. It is strongly recommended that all simultaneous immune-based involvements be searched prior to labeling a patient as having pure autoimmune hepatitis. The current study attempted to express all challenges about a case with overlap syndrome referred to the gastroenterology ward of Taleghani Hospital and to review the latest articles and related guidelines about the diagnosis, treatment, complications, and surveillance of the mentioned patient with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",

        "Abstract": "Despite advances in periodontal disease (PD) research and periodontal treatments, 42% of the US population suffer from periodontitis. PD can be prevented if high-risk patients are identified early to provide preventive care. Prediction models can help assess risk for PD before initiation and progression; nevertheless, utilization of existing PD prediction models is seldom because of their suboptimal performance. This study aims to develop and test the PD prediction model using machine learning (ML) and electronic dental record (EDR) data that could provide large sample sizes and up-to-date information. A cohort of 27,138 dental patients and grouped PD diagnoses into: healthy control, mild PD, and severe PD was generated. The ML model (XGBoost) was trained (80% training data) and tested (20% testing data) with a total of 74 features extracted from the EDR. We used a five-fold cross-validation strategy to identify the optimal hyperparameters of the model for this one-<i>vs</i>.-all multi-class classification task. Our prediction model differentiated healthy patients <i>vs</i>. mild PD cases and mild PD <i>vs</i>. severe PD cases with an average area under the curve of 0.72. New associations and features compared to existing models were identified that include patient-level factors such as patient anxiety, chewing problems, speaking trouble, teeth grinding, alcohol consumption, injury to teeth, presence of removable partial dentures, self-image, recreational drugs (Heroin and Marijuana), medications affecting periodontium, and medical conditions such as osteoporosis, cancer, neurological conditions, infectious diseases, endocrine conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and gastroenterology conditions. This pilot study demonstrated promising results in predicting the risk of PD using ML and EDR data. The model may provide new information to the clinicians about the PD risks and the factors responsible for the disease progression to take preventive approaches. Further studies are warned to evaluate the prediction model's performance on the external dataset and determine its usability in clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Describes the activities of a clinical pharmacist in a gastroenterology (GI) clinic providing services to hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, with a focus on practice management activities and tools. <b>Practice Description:</b> Located inside a GI specialty clinic in Fort Worth, Texas, the pharmacist provides comprehensive medication management under a collaborative practice agreement (CPA). Once referred by the GI physician, the pharmacist has face-to-face patient visits, develops the care plan, orders medications, and follows patients through sustained virologic response and the development of a hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance plan. <b>Practice Innovation:</b> The role of pharmacists in the management of HCV is important to understand. This article details a pharmacist-led clinic in an open GI medical practice. <b>Evaluation:</b> A retrospective chart review study was conducted to assess outcomes related to the integration of the clinical pharmacist. <b>Methods:</b> Completed by the study team, this study included manual chart reviews of patients with the ambulatory care pharmacist-driven HCV practice to pull data and information that were then tabulated using Qualtrics. <b>Results:</b> A total of 95 charts were surveyed, 78 records were created, and 49 patients were started on direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment by the pharmacist. Patients required multiple pharmacist communication actions. The minimum duration of the pharmacist service was 6 months and could extend more than 9 months depending on the time it took to get the patient started on medication. Pharmacist integration into the practice resulted in improved intake for the GI clinic, improved interprofessional interaction, and increased utilization of newer treatment modalities for HCV which feature cure rates up to 99% with limited side effects. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical pharmacists are well positioned to help navigate patients through the complexities of the medication use system, medication access, drug interactions and adverse effects, promote medication adherence, and allow patients to start and complete therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic lipid accumulation - which is known as NAFPD (non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease) - has gained an increasing attention in the last couple of years. Previously, this alteration was mentioned using different names. Undoubtedly, the term of NAFPD is still rarely used in the Hungarian scientific literature, even the proper translation should be considered difficult. Pancreatic lipid accumulation is a clinical manifestation of ectopic occurrence of adipose tissue. NAFPD can be diagnosed by different imaging modalities. Although proper quantification of pancreatic lipid accumulation is challenging, ultrasonography and computed tomography are used in clinical practice. The prevalence of NAFPD was about 30-35% in different adult populations but a relatively higher frequency might also be observed in children and adolescents with obesity. NAFPD may influence both endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas. Clinical studies documented a close correlation between NAFPD and type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome. Local consequences of pancreatic lipid accumulation are less recognized but clinical observations suggested that NAFPD might play a role in the development of acute and chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. Therapeutically, weight loss in patients with obesity, due to life-style modification, pharmacological intervention or bariatric surgery, may reduce pancreatic lipid accumulation. Importantly, antihyperglycemic treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes should be performed by using antidiabetic drugs providing not only proper glycaemic control but even weight loss. NAFPD is a relatively new clinical entity which is rather common and probably underdiagnosed. Basic and new data about NAFPD are of importance for clinicians working in the field of different specialties and sub-specialties (internal medicine, gastroenterology, diabetology, lipidology, obesitology, surgery).

        "Title": "Prevalence, characteristics, and mortality outcomes of obese and nonobese MAFLD in the United States.",
        "Abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) establishes new criteria for diagnosis of fatty liver disease independent of alcohol intake. We aimed to describe the prevalence and compare characteristics and mortality outcomes of persons with nonobese and obese MAFLD. Using data from 13,640 participants from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) 1988-1994, we identified participants with fatty liver on ultrasound who had MAFLD and analyzed them by the presence of obesity. Overall prevalence of MAFLD was 19%; amongst those, 54% were obese and 46% were nonobese. Nonobese MAFLD was more common in participants older than 65 than in younger participants (56.8% vs. 43.2%, p < 0.0001). Nonobese MAFLD was more common in males (63.2% vs. 48.3%, p < 0.0001). Obese MAFLD was more common in females (51.7% vs. 48.3%, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for several demographic factors and alcohol use, older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p = 0.003] and being male (aOR: 1.65, 95% CI 1.25-2.17, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for nonobese MAFLD. Nonobese MAFLD participants had a higher 20-year cumulative incidence for all-cause mortality compared to obese MAFLD participants (33.2% vs. 28.8%, p = 0.0137). However, nonobese MAFLD was not independently associated with mortality after adjusting for relevant confounders, while FIB-4 > 1.3 and cardiovascular disease were the strongest risk factors associated with increased mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)  > 2.7 for both, p < 0.0001 for both]. Nonobese MAFLD constitutes about half of the MAFLD in the United States, especially among males and the elderly. Notably, nonobese MAFLD carries higher mortality than obese MAFLD. Screening and diagnosis of MAFLD should be considered in nonobese populations.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction (PIPO) is a heterogeneous and severe group of disorders with a high mortality rate. Patients with PIPO often develop malnutrition and need long-term nutrition support. This study aimed to determine the nutrition status, particularly micronutrients, during the long-term follow-up of patients with PIPO. Fifty-eight patients with PIPO were followed up for at least 6 months between January 2008 and December 2020 in our hospital. PIPO was diagnosed based on the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus. Data on clinical characteristics, medical and surgical management, nutrition support, serum vitamins, and mineral concentrations were collected. The patients were divided into the early-onset PIPO (EO-PIPO; neonatal-onset) and late-onset PIPO (LO-PIPO; infant- or child-onset) groups. The mean follow-up was 29.5 months (6-153 months). The overall survival rate was 63.8% (37 out of 58 participants) (EO-PIPO, 48.6% [17 out of 35 participants]; LO-PIPO, 87.0% [20 out of 23 participants]). Mortality in the EO-PIPO group was higher than in the LO-PIPO group (P = 0.002). Twenty-one patients died, of which 18 (85.7%) patients had EO-PIPO and 14 (66.7%) patients died under 1 year of age. Infection was the major cause of death. Severe malnutrition was observed at baseline and during follow-up in 25 (43.1%) and 6 (16.2%) patients, respectively. At baseline and during follow-up, the zinc deficiency rates were 29.6% and 26.3%, and those of vitamin D were 26.9% and 52.6%, respectively. Zinc and vitamin D deficiencies are common in patients with PIPO during follow-up. Therefore, additional supplements should be recommended.",

        "Abstract": "Newer American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) guidelines do not suggest endoscopy to investigate alarm features for dyspepsia patients under the age of 60 to exclude upper gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasia. The validity of this recommendation has not been evaluated in our population. So, this study was conducted to assess the utility of upper GI endoscopy to investigate alarm features in dyspepsia patients less than 60 years of age to exclude upper GI neoplasia. This prospective observational study evaluated consecutive patients of dyspepsia between 18 and 60 years of age, with at least one or more of the alarm symptoms (unintentional weight loss; loss of appetite; GI bleeding; anemia; recurrent or persistent vomiting; dysphagia with predominant epigastric pain; and family history of upper GI cancer) with upper GI endoscopy to exclude any organic lesion and malignancy. Of total 294 patients evaluated with endoscopy, 34.7% (n=102) had normal endoscopy (functional dyspepsia [FD]) while 65.3% (n=192) had abnormal endoscopic findings (organic dyspepsia [OD]). Of 192 patients with OD, 146 patients (49.6% of the total study population) had benign abnormality (benign OD) while 46 patients (15.6% of the total study population) had malignancy of the upper GI tract (malignant OD). The investigation of alarm features in dyspepsia patients less than 60 years of age with upper GI endoscopy leads to detection of organic lesion (65.3%) including malignancy (15.6%) in a significant percentage of patients.",

        "Title": "Mutational analysis of exon 8 and exon 14 of ATP7B gene in Bangladeshi children with Wilson disease.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND : Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation in the Adenosine Triphosphate 7B (ATP7B) gene. The spectrum of ATP7B mutation varies in different populations. The objective of this study was to identify the mutation in exon 8 and exon 14 of ATP7B gene in Bangladeshi children clinically diagnosed as WD. We also aimed to explore the phenotypic presentation. It was a cross sectional observational study. The study was conducted at the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2017 to June 2018. A total of 37 patients diagnosed with WD were enrolled for the study. Venous blood (about 3 mL) was drawn aseptically from each patient into tube containing ethyline diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and preserved at -30°C for long-term preservation. The peripheral blood leukocytes of the patients and genomic DNAs were extracted. Exons 14 and 8 of ATP7B and their associated splice-site junctions were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The size and quantity of PCR products were verified by electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. 74 (37 × 2) PCR products were sent for Sanger Sequencing. The sequences were analyzed by Chromas version 2.6.6 software and the nucleotide blast was done by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleoblast. Finally, the sequences were analyzed using AB Applied Bio systems and were matched with the reference sequences using MEGA software. In this study, a single novel homozygous mutation pLeu.1071Val in the exon 14 was found in every (100%) studied child clinically diagnosed with WD. Heterozygous mutation p.Gly1061Glu in exon14 was also found in 6 patients (11%) with WD, which is one of the common mutations in this disease. In exon 8, p.Arg778Leu mutation was detected in one patient (2.7%), which is common in the Chinese and the South Asian populations and was heterozygous. Two novel heterozygous missense mutations p.K785R (2.7%) and p.S744F (2.7%) were also found in two other children in the exon 8. We found three novel mutations in Bangladeshi children with WD, one of which may be tagged as founder mutation for Bangladeshi population. This finding indicates the necessity to study the mutation profiles of the whole ATP7B gene in our population for risk prediction. A further large-scale study will help in the development of a Mutational Data Base of Bangladeshi population with WD.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the seasonality of paediatric intussusception and the associations between meteorological factors and paediatric intussusception in Hangzhou, as well as aimed to compare the variance in sex and disease type. An 8-year retrospective study was conducted from January 2014 to December 2021 in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. This was a single-centre retrospective study review of intussusception cases in a large Children's Hospital in Hangzhou. There were 17 674 patients with intussusception in this study. A Spearman correlation analysis and Poisson regression analysis were used to determine the association between weekly intussusception cases and meteorological factors. The seasonality of paediatric intussusception was demonstrated via the t-test and visualised. In January, May and December, there were relatively more intussusception patients. In February, there was a trough in the number of intussusception patients. Both the Spearman correlation analysis and Poisson regression analysis proved that weekly intussusception cases had significant associations with temperature (λ=-0.205, p<0.01; β=-0.080, p<0.01), feels-like temperature (λ=-0.214, p<0.01; β=-0.012, p<0.01), dew (λ=-0.249, p<0.01; β=0.095, p<0.01), humidity (λ=-0.230, p<0.01; β=-0.037, p<0.01), precipitation (λ=-0.148, p<0.01; β=-0.001, p<0.01), windspeed (λ=-0.135, p<0.01; β=0.005, p<0.01), visibility (λ=-0.206, p<0.01; β=-0.066, p<0.01), sea level pressure (λ=0.171, p<0.01; β=-0.004, p<0.01) and a total of 20 of 25 dynamic meteorological factors (p<0.05). These associations reflected gender differences but showed stronger associations in groups that were prone to recurrence. Paediatric intussusception in Hangzhou showed a seasonal tendency. Additionally, intussusception was significantly associated with certain meteorological factors in all of the cases. These findings suggest that parents and paediatricians should be more vigilant about the occurrence of intussusception in children regarding seasonal change times and climate change times.",

        "Abstract": "Scarce data are available on the use of vedolizumab in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and dosing of vedolizumab to induce remission of IBD. VEDOKIDS was a paediatric, multicentre, prospective cohort study done in 17 centres in six countries. We report the 14-week outcomes as the first analyses of the planned 3-year follow-up of the VEDOKIDS cohort. Children (aged 0-18 years) with IBD who had commenced vedolizumab were followed up at baseline and at 2, 6, and 14 weeks. Children were managed according to local prescribing practices without standardisation of dosing or criteria for escalation, but the study protocol suggested dosing of 177 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (up to 300 mg maximum). The primary outcome was steroid-free and exclusive enteral nutrition-free remission at 14 weeks, analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Serum samples were taken for analysis of drug concentration and faecal calprotectin at baseline, and at 2, 6, and 14 weeks. Adverse events were recorded in real time and classified as severe or non-severe and related or unrelated to vedolizumab. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02862132. Between May 19, 2016, and April 1, 2022, 142 children (76 [54%] girls and 66 [46%] boys; mean age 13·6 years [SD 3·6]) were enrolled. 65 (46%) children had Crohn's disease, 68 (48%) had ulcerative colitis, and nine (6%) had unclassified IBD (those with unclassified IBD were analysed with the ulcerative colitis group). 32 (42% [95% CI 30-54]) of 77 children with ulcerative colitis and 21 (32% [23-45]) of 65 children with Crohn's disease were in steroid-free and exclusive enteral nutrition-free remission at 14 weeks. Median drug concentrations at week 14 were higher in children with ulcerative colitis than in those with Crohn's disease (11·5 μg/mL [IQR 5·5-18·1] vs 5·9 μg/mL [3·0-12·7]; p=0·006). In children who weighed less than 30 kg, the optimal drug concentration associated with steroid-free and exclusive enteral nutrition-free clinical remission was 7 μg/mL at week 14 (area under the curve 0·69 [95% CI 0·41-0·98]), corresponding to a dose of 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area or 10 mg/kg. 32 (23%) of 142 children reported at least one adverse event, the most common were headache (five [4%]), myalgia (four [3%]), and fever (three [2%]). None of the adverse events were classified as severe, and only two (1%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Vedolizumab showed good safety and effectiveness at inducing remission in children with IBD at 14 weeks, especially those with ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab should be considered in children when other approved drug interventions for IBD are unsuccessful. In children who weigh less than 30 kg, vedolizumab should be dosed by the child's body surface area (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or weight (10 mg/kg).

        "Abstract": "To evaluate whether providing a constipation action plan (CAP) to families of children with constipation at outpatient gastroenterology (GI) visits affects health care utilization of the GI department. We created a CAP to be included in the after visit summary of children seen in our GI Clinic. We compared the number of patient telephone calls, electronic messages, and urgent care (UC) visits, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations within 3 months after the visit of patients who received the CAP compared to those who did not using inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis. For families who received the CAP at a follow-up visit, we compared these variables in the 3 months before and after the CAP was provided using paired t test and McNemar's test as appropriate. We included 336 patients who received the CAP and 2812 who did not. After IPTW adjustment, there were fewer patient telephone calls for patients who received the CAP (P = 0.0006). The difference in patient electronic messages was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). For the 45 patients who received the CAP at a follow-up visit, there were on average 1.8 more patient telephone calls made prior to receiving the CAP than after (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-2.8; P = 0.0007) and 2.3 more patient electronic messages received (95% CI = 0.1-4.5; P = 0.04). There were no differences in UC/emergency department visits or hospitalizations. We found that providing a CAP to families of children with constipation decreases health care utilization. Further studies are needed to determine whether this impacts patient outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "European Crohn's Colitis Organization (ECCO) and the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines recommend the early use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologicals in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) patients with positive predictors for poor outcome. The objective of the present study was to compare early \"Top-Down\" use of adalimumab (ADA) immunomodulator/biologics-naive patients to conventional \"Step-Up\" management. One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CD and treated with ADA between 2008 and 2019 were included and allocated to the ADA-Top Down (n = 59) or ADA-Step Up group (n = 61). The primary endpoint was prolonged steroid-/enteral nutrition-free clinical remission at 24 months, defined by a weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) < 12.5. Clinical and biological data were collected at 12 and 24 months. At start of ADA, disease activity was comparable between the ADA-Top Down group and the ADA-Step Up group (wPCDAI = 31 ± 16 vs 31.3 ± 15.2, respectively, P = 0.84). At 24 months, the remission rate was significantly higher in the ADA-Top Down group (73% vs 51%, P < 0.01). After propensity score, the Top-Down strategy is still more effective than the Step-Up strategy in maintaining remission at 24 months [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.36, 95% CI (0.15-0.87), P = 0.02]. Patients in the ADA-Top Down group were mainly on monotherapy compared to patients in the ADA-Step Up group (53/55 vs 28/55 respectively, P < 0.001). Serum levels of ADA were higher in the ADA-Top Down group than in the ADA-Step Up group (12.8 ± 4.3 vs 10.4 ± 3.9 µg/mL, respectively, P < 0.01). There were no serious adverse events. Early use of ADA appears to be more effective in maintaining relapse-free remission at 2 years, while using it as monotherapy. These findings further favor the recommendation of early anti-TNF use in high-risk CD patients.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, biological agents, such as anti-TNF-α blockers, have been introduced and have shown efficacy in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, the prescription mode differentiated into a first/second line application, and efficacy and side effects are evaluated beginning from 2004 until today. Statistical analyses of the prospective and ongoing CEDATA multicenter registry data from the Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (GPGE) were performed for patients receiving a biological agent at least once during the period from June 2004 until November 2020 (<i>n</i> = 487). The analyzed parameters were patient demographics, disease extent and behavior, prior or concurrent therapies, duration and outcome of biological therapy, disease-associated complications, drug-related complications, laboratory parameters and treatment response as determined by the Physician's Global Assessment. Crohn's disease (CD) was present in 71.5% of patients, and 52% were boys. Patients showed high disease activity when receiving a first-line TNF-α blocker. After 2016, patients who failed to respond to anti-TNF-α induction therapy were treated with off-label biologics (vedolizumab 4.3% and ustekinumab 2.1%). Propensity score matching indicated that patients with CD and higher disease activity benefitted significantly more from early anti-TNF-α therapy. This assessment was based on a clinical evaluation and lab parameters related to inflammation compared to delayed second-line treatment. Additionally, first-line treatment resulted in less treatment failure and fewer extraintestinal manifestations during TNF-α blockade. First-line treatment with anti-TNF-α drugs is effective and safe. An earlier start significantly reduces the risk of treatment failure and is associated with fewer extraintestinal manifestations during longitudinal follow-up.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship among lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (Hp), and gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The retrospective study included patients with isolated hypertensive or hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES) who underwent esophageal manometry in our gastroenterology motility laboratory and had normal manometry results. Demographic characteristics, complaints on admission, upper endoscopy findings, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring results, and presence of Hp in gastric biopsy were evaluated. A total of 1226 patients were included in the study, among whom women comprised 54% of all patients. Mean age was 45.4±13.4 years. Most common presenting complaint was pyrosis (85.4%). Pathological reflux was detected in 61.4% of the patients in 24-h esophageal pH monitoring. Reflux esophagitis was detected in 22.9% and LES laxity was present in 17.4% of the patients. In gastric biopsy, Hp was positive in 40% of the patients. The age of patients with hypertensive LES was significantly higher and female gender and body mass index (BMI) were associated with hypertensive LES. Pyrosis was significantly less prevalent in patients with hypertensive LESP. Esophagitis and LES laxity were significantly more prevalent in patients with hypotensive LES. No significant difference was found among the three groups with regard to reflux and Hp positivity. No significant difference was found between Hp-positive and Hp-negative groups with regard to reflux and reflux esophagitis. No clear relationship was found among LES disorders, GER, and Hp. Moreover, no significant difference was found among LES disorders with regard to GER, while the presence of hypotensive LESP, rather than Hp, was found to be an important factor in the development of reflux esophagitis.",

While Journal Impact Factor (JIF), calculated by Clarivate and based upon the Web of Science literature database, and CiteScore (CS), developed by Elseiver and based upon the Scopus database, have enjoyed high uptake worldwide, efforts continue towards creation of other scientometric indexes that will provide ever-greater qualitative insights into journal impact. Such efforts have yielded the newly-launched <i>Journal Article Influence Index</i> (<i>JAII</i>), which is based on the <i>Reference Citation Analysis</i> (<i>RCA</i>) database, an open multidisciplinary citation analysis database based on artificial intelligence technology. To evaluate and summarize the similarities and differences between <i>JAII</i> and JIF/CS as journal evaluation indicators, and provide an intuitive method for visual representation of the related data. We searched the Journal Citation Reports to obtain the 2021 JIF list, downloaded the CS list updated in July on the Scopus website, and collected the comprehensive list of 2022 <i>JAII</i>s from the <i>RCA</i> database (www.referencecitationanalysis.com). Our research results revealed that by breaking through the time limit of mainstream journal evaluation methods, the <i>JAII</i> is able to perform well in data reliability, establishing its benefit as a complementary scientometric index to JIF and CS. <i>JAII</i> provides comprehensive assessment of the quality and performance of journals.",

It can automatically make a quantitative assessment of complex medical images and help doctors to make more accurate diagnoses. In recent years, AI based on ultrasound has been shown to be very helpful in diffuse liver diseases and focal liver lesions, such as analyzing the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver and the stage of liver fibrosis, identifying benign and malignant liver lesions, predicting the microvascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma, curative transarterial chemoembolization effect, and prognoses after thermal ablation. Moreover, AI based on endoscopic ultrasonography has been applied in some gastrointestinal diseases, such as distinguishing gastric mesenchymal tumors, detection of pancreatic cancer and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and predicting the preoperative tumor deposits in rectal cancer. This review focused on the basic technical knowledge about AI and the clinical application of AI in ultrasound of liver and gastroenterology diseases.

        "Abstract": "Peroral endoscopic myotomy is an increasingly used less invasive modality to treat esophageal dysmotility. Recently, triangular tip knife with integrated water jet function has been introduced to mitigate multiple instrument exchanges. To compare traditional triangular tip knife and water jet knife in terms of procedural success, duration, instrument exchanges, coagulation forceps use, and adverse events. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis with two authors independently in electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) from inception through May 2021. In addition, we conducted a relevant search by <i>Reference Citation Analysis</i> (RCA) (https://www.referencecitationanalysis.com). A fixed-effects model was used to calculate weighted mean, odds ratio (OR), and confidence intervals (CI). We included 7 studies involving 558 patients. Triangular knife and water jet knife were similar in odds of procedural success with ratio of 4.78 (95%CI = 0.22-102.47) and odds of clinical success with ratio of 0.93 (95%CI = 0.29-2.97), respectively. Water jet knife had fewer instrument exchanges compared to triangular knife (2.21, 95%CI = 1.98-2.45 <i>vs</i> 11.9, 95%CI = 11.15-12.70) and usage of coagulation forceps (1.75, 95%CI = 1.52-1.97 <i>vs</i> 2.63, 95%CI = 2.37-2.89). Adverse events were higher in triangular knife group (OR: 2.30, 95%CI = 1.35-3.95). Peroral endoscopic myotomy using water jet knife is comparable in terms of procedural success to triangular tip knife. Water jet knife also required shorter procedural duration, less instrument exchanges, coagulation devices, and overall adverse events.",

        "Abstract": "Tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEFs) can be described as a pathological communication between the trachea and the esophagus. According to their origin, they may be classified as benign or malignant. Benign TEFs occur mostly as a consequence of prolonged mechanical ventilation, particularly among patients exposed to endotracheal cuff overinflation. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus pandemic, the amount of patients requiring prolonged ventilation rose, which in turn increased the incidence of TEFs. We report the cases of 14 patients with different comorbidities such as being overweight, or having been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or systemic hypertension. The most common symptoms on arrival were dyspnea and cough. In all cases, the diagnosis of TEFs was made through upper endoscopy. Depending on the location and size of each fistula, either endoscopic or surgical treatment was provided. Eight patients were treated endoscopically. Successful closure of the defect was achieved through over the scope clips in two patients, while three of them required endoscopic metal stenting. A hemoclip was used to successfully treat one patient, and it was used temporarily for another patient pended surgery. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with failed endoscopic management, leading to successful defect correction. Two patients died before receiving corrective treatment and four died later on in their clinical course due to infectious complications. The incidence of TEFs increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (from 0.5% to 1.5%). We believe that endoscopic treatment should be considered as an option for this group of patients, since evidence reported in the literature is still a growing area. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to lead intervention in patients presenting with TEFs due to prolonged intubation.",

        "Title": "Intestinal epithelial BLT1 promotes mucosal repair.",
        "Abstract": "Acute and chronic intestinal inflammation is associated with epithelial damage, resulting in mucosal wounds in the forms of erosions and ulcers in the intestinal tract. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and immune cells in the wound milieu secrete cytokines and lipid mediators to influence repair. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a lipid chemokine, binds to its receptor BLT1 and promotes migration of immune cells to sites of active inflammation; however, a role for intestinal epithelial BLT1 during mucosal wound repair is not known. Here we report that BLT1 was expressed in IECs both in vitro and in vivo, where it functioned as a receptor not only for LTB4 but also for another ligand, resolvin E1. Intestinal epithelial BLT1 expression was increased when epithelial cells were exposed to an inflammatory microenvironment. Using human and murine primary colonic epithelial cells, we reveal that the LTB4/BLT1 pathway promoted epithelial migration and proliferation leading to accelerated epithelial wound repair. Furthermore, in vivo intestinal wound repair experiments in BLT1-deficient mice and bone marrow chimeras demonstrated an important contribution of epithelial BLT1 during colonic mucosal wound repair. Taken together, our findings show a potentially novel prorepair in IEC mechanism mediated by BLT1 signaling.",

Disease remission is associated with better outcomes than symptomatic care alone. The Treat-to-Target paradigm provides targets that serve as surrogates for achieving disease remission. The most important target is endoscopic mucosal healing and other targets include symptomatic response, symptomatic remission, biomarker normalization, and normalization of patient's quality of life. Targets are reached via utilization of biologic medications that may be modified or substituted as goals are not met.

        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal procedures generally require pre-procedural fasting to optimize sedation safety. While the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommends no intake of clear liquids and solid food 2-4 and 6-8 hours respectively prior to endoscopic procedures, the actual nil per os (NPO) duration for these procedures in practice is unknown. Our objective was to analyze NPO duration for patients undergoing these procedures and to determine its association with clinical and administrative variables. Inpatient data from 2016-2018 for the three procedures was extracted from electronic medical records and administrative data at a single-center tertiary academic medical center. Various statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, Pearson) were employed depending on the outcome type and data distribution. One thousand three hundred and twenty-five esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs), 753 colonoscopies, and 550 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) were included. The median NPO time for all procedures was 12.6 hours (IQR, 9.6-16.1 hours). The median NPO times were 12.6, 11.9, and 13.1 hours for EGD, colonoscopy, and ERCP respectively. NPO duration was greater for Hispanic than non-Hispanic patients (median 13.9 <i>vs</i>. 12.4, P=0.018). NPO duration was also associated with increased age (r=0.041, P=0.027) and inversely related to hospital occupancy (r=-0.08, P<0.0001). There were no statistically significant associations with provider type, hospital location or service, length of stay, and total number of comorbidities. NPO times for common inpatient gastroenterology (GI) procedures generally exceeded 12 hours, suggesting there is an opportunity to adopt changes to decrease NPO duration for low-risk patients while maintaining adherence to guidelines and best practice.",

        "Abstract": "Background. Among patients with celiac disease (CD), there is an increased incidence of autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs), with hypothyroidism being more frequent than hyperthyroidism. This retrospective case-control study aimed to explore the prevalence of TDs in a population of adult celiac patients from Northern Sardinia, a geographic area with a high prevalence of autoimmune disorders. Methods. Data were collected from consecutive patients with CD (cases) and without CD (controls) who were undergoing upper endoscopy and referred to a tertiary gastroenterology section of a teaching hospital (University of Sassari, Italy). Thyroid disorders were stratified as (i) autoimmune: including Hashimoto’s disease in euthyroidism or with hypofunction, and Graves’ disease; or (ii) non-autoimmune: thyroid nodules/goiter, iatrogenic thyroid hypo/hyperfunction, and thyroidectomy for any reason, including cancer. Results. Among a total of 8489 participants (females 5839, 64.7%) enrolled, there were 623 (7.3%) celiac patients and 7866 controls (92.7%). The overall frequency of TDs was 1177 (13.9%) and was higher (26.0%) in celiac patients than in controls (12.9%) (p < 0.001). The difference between AITDs (15.4% vs. 7.5%) and no-AITDs (2.7% vs. 1.1%) was statistically significant in CD patients compared with controls, respectively, and prevailed in the fifth and sixth decades. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was more commonly associated with gland hypofunction. Odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the presence of AITDs were calculated, adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, smoking habits, occupation, and residence, and they were 2.387 (95% CI 1.857−3.068, p < 0.001) in CD patients, 5.855 (95% CI 4.434−7.731, p < 0.001) for female sex, and 1.012 (95% CI, 1.007−1.017, p < 0.001) for age. Conclusion. These results suggest the need for surveillance for TDs in patients with CD at onset and during follow-up.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and complex disease that requires a multidisciplinary team, including clinical pharmacists, to improve the quality of care and patient outcome. This present study aimed to assess the satisfaction of patients with IBD and physicians regarding clinical pharmacist interventions in outpatient and inpatient settings. A survey-based study was performed between 1 March and 1 August 2022 in a tertiary care IBD center. Two different questionnaires were distributed among patients and physicians focusing on satisfaction with the clinical pharmacist services. Patient demographics were obtained. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results of the survey. A total of 108 patients with IBD and 23 physicians participated in this study. Among study participants, Crohn's disease (CD) accounted for 64.8% of the total participants, while 35.2% of patients had ulcerative colitis (UC). Regarding the patient survey, most patients were extremely satisfied with clinical pharmacists' services, during which the majority strongly agreed or agreed that they were satisfied with the counseling session. However, five patients were unsure about the amount of time spent with the clinical pharmacist. There were no patients dissatisfied with any of the services. Finally, two physicians were not sure regarding clinical pharmacists monitoring patients' responses in of terms of toxicity and adverse effects. the current study illustrates patients' and physicians' high satisfaction with clinical pharmacists' services in outpatient and inpatient settings. The findings of this study as well as previous studies necessitate expanding the clinical pharmacist services in the gastroenterology field.",

        "Title": "Dental erosion as an indicator of gastroesophageal reflux disease.",
        "Abstract": "While evidence shows that dental erosion (DE) is often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the relationship of DE severity to a patient's symptoms and receipt of appropriate medical treatment for GERD is not clearly understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between DE and GERD. Eighty participants underwent a Basic Erosive Wear Examination for DE and completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) survey on symptoms of gastrointestinal reflux (PROMIS Scale v1.0, Gastrointestinal Gastroesophageal Reflux 13a) in English. Patients with observed erosive patterns were referred for gastroenterologic evaluation. The association between DE and GERD was assessed using multiple regression. The results showed that the extent of DE was positively associated with GERD symptoms (B = 0.585; 95% CI, 0.21-0.96), as measured by the PROMIS survey, in participants without a current diagnosis of GERD. Of the 80 patients in the study, 28 with more severe DE were evaluated in the gastroenterology department. A diagnosis of GERD was established for 27 of the 28, 9 of whom denied a past history of the disease. Twenty patients with GERD underwent upper endoscopy, and esophageal lesions were found in 6 patients (erosive esophagitis in 5 and Barrett esophagus in 1). Patients with clinically identified DE may benefit from medical evaluation and, if necessary, management of GERD. For a subset of patients, DE may be the only clinical indication of untreated or undertreated GERD, which could lead to serious esophageal changes. Dentists should consider referring patients with DE to primary care providers or gastrointestinal specialists to ensure that systemic conditions are identified and managed appropriately.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes and practices of US healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) vaccination recommendations on HepA and HepB for adult patients at risk of contracting these infections or experiencing complications of hepatitis disease. This cross-sectional, web-based survey of 400 US HCPs, which included nurse practitioners and family medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, emergency department, and gastroenterology physicians, assessed HCPs' attitudes and practices regarding the ACIP recommendations for adult patients at risk for hepatitis disease. HCP participants were identified via a survey research panel. A recruitment quota of 400 HCPs was set, including 50 NPs, 100 FMs, 100 IMs, 50 GIs, 50 EDs, and 50 IDs. The most frequently reported reasons for not recommending either HepA or HepB vaccines were \"I think the risk of HepA infection is low in this patient population\" and \"I am uncertain about what the guidelines say about vaccinating this population.\" The most reported factors considered when determining eligibility for either vaccine were medical history and the patient's willingness/motivation to be vaccinated. Most reported it was extremely or moderately important to prevent hepatitis disease by vaccinating adult patients at risk, and most also reported recommending a HepA vaccine or HepB vaccine to patients at risk. Although most HCPs reported recommending HepA and HepB vaccines to patients at risk, these findings contrast with the low reported vaccination rates among these populations, and improved awareness of the ACIP recommendations among HCPs is needed.",

        "Abstract": "Outbreaks of sexually transmitted shigella have been reported in men who have sex with men (MSM) since the 1970s and present a major public health issue. Understanding the factors associated with the sexual transmission of shigella may inform future control strategies. We systematically searched four bibliographical databases (January 2000-February 2022) for manuscripts in English. We used a two-stage process to assess eligibility: the primary author conducted an initial screen and then three authors conducted independent full-text reviews to determine the final eligible manuscripts. We only included manuscripts that included MSM diagnosed with sexually transmitted shigella where specific factors associated with transmission were identified. Thirteen manuscripts met the inclusion criteria that included 547 individuals. Sexually transmitted shigella in MSM was associated with: residing in a capital city/urban region, living with HIV (including engaging in seroadaptive sexual behaviour, having a low CD4 count, having a HIV viral load >100 000 and not engaging with HIV care), using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, use of geospatial mobile phone applications to meet sexual partners, visiting sex on premises venues, chemsex and recreational drug use, sexual behaviour (including multiple non-regular sexual partners and oral-anal sexual contact) and concomitant STIs. We have highlighted some important risk behaviours and factors that are associated with sexually transmitted shigella in MSM that can be used to target future shigella control interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and food allergy (FA) are common conditions, especially during the first 12 months of life. When GOR leads to troublesome symptoms, that affect the daily functioning of the infant and family, it is referred to as GOR disease (GORD). The role of food allergens as a cause of GORD remains controversial. This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) position paper aims to review the evidence for FA-associated GORD in young children and translate this into clinical practice that guides healthcare professionals through the diagnosis of suspected FA-associated GORD and medical and dietary management. The task force (TF) on non-IgE mediated allergy consists of EAACI experts in paediatric gastroenterology, allergy, dietetics and psychology from Europe, United Kingdom, United States, Turkey and Brazil. Six clinical questions were formulated, amended and approved by the TF to guide this publication. A systematic literature search using PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE databases (until June 2021) using predefined inclusion criteria based on the 6 questions was used. The TF also gained access to the database from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology working group, who published guidelines on GORD and ensured that all publications used within that position paper were included. For each of the 6 questions, practice points were formulated, followed by a modified Delphi method consisting of anonymous web-based voting that was repeated with modified practice points where required, until at least 80% consensus for each practice point was achieved. This TF position paper shares the process, the discussion and consensus on all practice points on FA-associated GORD.",

The observational study was conducted from September 2020 to January 2021 at the Gastroenterology outpatient department of Dr Ziauddin Hospital's Clifton unit in Karachi, and comprised all patients visiting the facility regardless of age and gender. Data was collected using a questionnaire that was first filled up by the receptionist outside the clinic and was then administered again once the patient entered the clinic. Discrepancy on the answers was then checked and associations were determined with clinical assessment. Data was analysed using SPSS 20. Of the 300 patients, 184(61.3%) were males and 116(38.6%) were females. The overall mean age was 55 ± 16.98 (range: 18-92 years).

        "Abstract": "Enteric viruses are commonly found obligate parasites in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These viruses usually follow a fecal-oral route of transmission and are characterized by their extraordinary stability as well as resistance in high-stress environments. Most of them cause similar symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In order to come in contract with mucosal surfaces, these viruses need to pass the three main lines of defense: mucus layer, innate immune defenses, and adaptive immune defenses. The following atypical gastrointestinal infections are discussed: SARS-CoV2, hantavirus, herpes simplex virus I, cytomegalovirus, and calicivirus. Dysbiosis represents any modification to the makeup of resident commensal communities from those found in healthy individuals and can cause a patient to become more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections. The interaction between bacteria, viruses, and host physiology is still not completely understood. However, with growing research on viral infections, dysbiosis, and new methods of detection, we are getting closer to understanding the nature of these viruses, their typical and atypical characteristics, long-term effects, and mechanisms of action in different organ systems.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic autoimmune condition that can have a wide range of symptoms among pediatric patients. Although clinical symptoms like hematochezia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are commonly addressed, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is often overlooked in patients with IBD and pediatric patients with chronic disease in general. Examining HRQOL can help improve patient outcomes, but it has been studied sparingly. In this review, we aim to compare HRQOL between pediatric patients suffering from IBD and healthy children, as well as those suffering from other illnesses. We searched through peer-reviewed primary literature related to IBD and HRQOL and selected 10 articles from the PubMed database to be reviewed. Our inclusion criteria included articles published after the year 2000 in English, primary studies, and those that corresponded to the aim of this review. Case reports and secondary and tertiary articles were excluded from our review. We found that patients with IBD reported worse HRQOL in terms of overall health and in various subdomains, including physical health and fatigue, compared to their healthy counterparts. However, children with IBD demonstrated a comparable HRQOL with children suffering from functional abdominal pain (FAP) and obesity. Additionally, children with IBD displayed a greater HRQOL than pediatric patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and chronic constipation. In addressing the aim of this review, we found that children with IBD had a lower HRQOL when compared to healthy children, but a comparable or greater HRQOL than other sick children. Some factors associated with a reduced HRQOL include disease activity, age, fatigue, gender, psychological variables, and associated symptoms. Going forward, HRQOL should be considered by practitioners when caring for pediatric IBD patients in a clinical setting as it can help improve patient care. More studies need to be conducted to further explore HRQOL in pediatric patients. This can help implement early psychosocial interventions in children to reduce the disease burden.",

        "Abstract": "To validate the Chinese language version of the Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8) in a sample of outpatients attending tertiary hospitals in China. A Chinese language version of the SSS-8 was completed by outpatients (<i>n</i> = 699) from psychosomatic medicine, gastroenterology/neurology, and traditional Chinese medicine clinics of nine tertiary hospitals between September 2016 and January 2018 to test the reliability. The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), the Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale (SSD-12), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, the Medical Outcome Study 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO DAS 2.0) were rated to test construct validity. The criterion validity was tested by using the Semi-structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Research Version) (SCID-5-RV) for somatic symptom disorder (SSD) as the diagnostic gold standard to explore the optimal cutoff score of the SSS-8. The average age of the recruited participants was 43.08 (±14.47). 61.4% of them were female. The internal consistency derived from the sample was acceptable (Cronbach α = 0.78). Confirmatory factor analyses resulted in the replication of a three-factor model (cardiopulmonary symptoms, pain symptoms, gastrointestinal and fatigue symptoms) (comparative fit index = 0.95, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation = 0.10, 90% confidence interval = 0.08-0.12). The SSS-8 sum score was highly associated with PHQ-15 (<i>r</i> = 0.74, <i>p</i> < 0.001), SSD-12 (<i>r</i> = 0.64, <i>p</i> < 0.001), GAD-7 (<i>r</i> = 0.59, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and PHQ-9 (<i>r</i> = 0.69, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The patients with more severe symptoms showed worse quality of life and disability The optimal cutoff score of SSS-8 was 9 (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.68). Our preliminary assessment suggests that the Chinese language version of the SSS-8 has reliability and validity sufficient to warrant testing further in research and clinical settings.",

The LiverTAI study focused on patients tested for HCV using AI technologies to describe their demographic and clinical characteristics and pre-testing patient journeys, reflecting clinical practice in hospitals. LiverTAI is a retrospective, secondary analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) from 6 tertiary Spanish hospitals, extracting unstructured clinical data using natural language processing (NLP) EHRead® technology. Adult subjects with an HCV testing procedure from January 2014 to December 2018 were grouped according to HCV seropositivity and viremia. From 2,440,358 patients, 16,261 patients were tested for HCV (13,602 [83.6%] HCV seronegative; 2659 [16.4%] seropositive). Active HCV viremia appeared in 37.7% (n=1003) of patients, 18.6% (n=494) had negative viremia, and 43.7% (n=1162) unknown viremia. Patient journeys showed core departments (Gastroenterology, Internal Medicine, and Infectious Disease) and others including Emergency perform ample HCV testing in Spanish hospitals, whereas Medical Oncology lags. Patients were PCR-tested and genotyped significantly faster in core departments (p<.001). Our results highlight hospital departments responsible for HCV testing. However, further testing was sub-optimal during the study period. Therefore, we underscore the need for HCV screening and reflex testing to accelerate diagnosis and linkage-to-care.",

        "Abstract": "Recommendations regarding signs and symptoms that should prompt referral of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to an IBD specialist for a consultation could serve to improve the quality of care for these patients. Our aim was to develop a consult care pathway consisting of clinical features related to IBD that should prompt appropriate consultation. A scoping literature review was performed to identify clinical features that should prompt consultation with an IBD specialist. A panel of 11 experts was convened over 4 meetings to develop a consult care pathway using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Items identified via scoping review were ranked and were divided into major and minor criteria. Additionally, a literature and panel review was conducted assessing potential barriers and facilitators to implementing the consult care pathway. Of 43 features assessed, 13 were included in the care pathway as major criteria and 15 were included as minor criteria. Experts agreed that stratification into major criteria and minor criteria was appropriate and that 1 major or 2 or more minor criteria should be required to consider consultation. The greatest barrier to implementation was considered to be organizational resource allocation, while endorsements by national gastroenterology and general medicine societies were considered to be the strongest facilitator. This novel referral care pathway identifies key criteria that could be used to triage patients with IBD who would benefit from IBD specialist consultation. Future research will be required to validate these findings and assess the impact of implementing this pathway in routine IBD-related care.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) have multiple and/or large serrated colonic polyps and higher risk for colorectal cancer. SPS inherited genetic basis is mostly unknown. We aimed to identify new germline predisposition factors for SPS by functionally evaluating a candidate gene and replicating it in additional SPS cohorts. After a previous whole-exome sequencing in 39 SPS patients from 16 families (discovery cohort), we sequenced specific genes in an independent validation cohort of 211 unrelated SPS cases. Additional external replication was also available in 297 SPS cases. The <i>WNK2</i> gene was disrupted in HT-29 cells by gene editing, and <i>WNK2</i> variants were transfected using a lentiviral delivery system. Cells were analysed by immunoblots, real-time PCR and functional assays monitoring the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, cell cycle progression, survival and adhesion. We identified 2 rare germline variants in the <i>WNK2</i> gene in the discovery cohort, 3 additional variants in the validation cohort and 10 other variants in the external cohorts. Variants c.2105C>T (p.Pro702Leu), c.4820C>T (p.Ala1607Val) and c.6157G>A (p.Val2053Ile) were functionally characterised, displaying higher levels of phospho-PAK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, CCND1, clonogenic capacity and MMP2. After whole-exome sequencing in SPS cases with familial aggregation and replication of results in additional cohorts, we identified rare germline variants in the <i>WNK2</i> gene. Functional studies suggested germline <i>WNK2</i> variants affect protein function in the context of the MAPK pathway, a molecular hallmark in this disease.",

        "Abstract": "The Houston Consensus Conference and American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) have recommended Helicobacter pylori screening in United States populations with specific risk factors. However, the performance of these guidelines in clinical practice is not known. We identified consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies for any indication in a safety-net hospital in Houston, TX during January 2015-December 2016. We tested the association between the presence of H pylori (histopathology, stool antigen, urea breath test, immunoglobulin G serology, or prior treatment) and H pylori risk factors using logistic regression models, reported as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for predictive ability of individual risk factors identified by the Houston Consensus Conference and ACG. Of 942 patients, the prevalence of H pylori infection was 51.5%. The risk factors with the highest predictive performance included first-generation immigrant (AUROC, 0.59) and Hispanic or black race/ethnicity (AUROC, 0.57), whereas the remaining 7 risk factors/statements had low predictive value. A model that combined first-generation immigrant status, black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, dyspepsia, and reflux had higher predictive ability for H pylori infection (AUROC, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.61-0.68) than any individual risk factor. In this contemporary U.S. cohort, the performance of individual risk factors identified by the Houston Consensus Conference and ACG was generally low for predicting H pylori infection except for black or Hispanic race/ethnicity and first-generation immigrant status. A risk prediction model combining several risk factors had improved diagnostic performance and should be validated in future studies.",

We report a single case of a young 21 years old girl who had no potential risk of splenic artery aneurysm on clinical presentation, for gastroenterology disease only assessment and attention in our facility. The patient born and raised on a tropical island in Southern China was clinically diagnosed with splenic artery aneurysm-associated gastroenterological complications which was presented earlier as hematemesis. The patient was considered to have received optimal critical care by our multidisciplinary team and classical features displayed within the clinical settings are worth documenting and contribute perfectly to medical literature as the patient on follow-up is now back to normal life. Our patient recovered excellently on critically close follow-up since the patient had special gastroenterology associated complication features which masked the splenic artery aneurysm with very encouraging post-operative parameters or results. The patient was considered to have received optimal multidisciplinary quaternary medical care for SAAs with gastroenterology-associated complications in our interventional cardiovascular and gastroenterology medicine department.",

        "Abstract": "Sheng-Xue-Xiao-Ban Capsule (SXXBC), as a classic Chinese traditional medicine comprised of natural indigo, cortex moutan, forsythia, herba agrimoniae, and licorice, exhibits a heat-clearing and detoxicating function, hemostasis, and stasis dissipation, which is widely applied to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). However, report on ischemic colitis and pulmonary embolism induced by SXXBC therapy is never disclosed. We report the case of an ITP patient who received SXXBC for ascending platelets that then induced ischemic colitis and pulmonary embolism. A 74-year-old female patient was admitted in June 2021 due to \"bleeding in stool for 1 day,\" she was then re-admitted in July 2021 due to \"repeated bleeding in stool for 2 days\". Abdominal computed tomography (CT), colonoscopy, and a pathological examination suggested ischemic colitis according to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guidelines. Pulmonary artery CT angiography suggested pulmonary embolism reflected by multiple filling defects, and the patient presented with shortness of breath. It was noted that the patient had started taken SXXBC for ascending platelets 2 months before the onset of hematochezia. After the diagnosis of hematochezia was made, the patient received phenethylamine and carbazochrome for hemostasis, mesalazine enteric-coated tablets for anti-inflammation, and SXXBC was stopped. The hematochezia then ceased, and the ischemic colitis was attenuated. Afterwards, low-molecular-weight heparin was administered, followed by a 3-week treatment of rivaroxaban anticoagulant, which was taken orally after discharge. The pulmonary embolism was then obviously ameliorated. After excluding other causes, the patient was diagnosed with SXXBC-induced ischemic colitis complicated by pulmonary embolism. After conducting research, we came to the view that natural indigo, which is the main component of SXXBC, contributed to the patient's illness. Ischemic colitis complicated with pulmonary embolism are rare; however, close attention such as regular abdominal CT test needs to be paid and preventive steps such as anti-coagulant treatment could to be taken (if symptoms occur) when treating patients with SXXBC.",

The aim of this survey, which was part of a global survey on PGHN training in Europe, was to assess endoscopy training opportunities provided across Europe. <b>Methods </b> Responses to standardized questions related to endoscopy training were collected from training centers across Europe through the presidents/representatives of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition National Societies from June 2016 to December 2019. <b>Results </b> A total of 100 training centers from 19 countries participated in the survey. In 57 centers, the endoscopy suit was attached to the PGHN center, while in 23, pediatric endoscopies were performed in adult endoscopy facilities. Ninety percent of centers reported the availability of specialized endoscopy nurses and 96 % of pediatric anesthetists. Pediatric endoscopies were performed by PGHN specialists in 55 centers, while 31 centers reported the involvement of an adult endoscopist and 14 of a pediatric surgeon. Dividing the number of procedures performed at the training center by the number of trainees, ≤ 20 upper, lower, or therapeutic endoscopies per trainee per year were reported by 0 %, 23 %, and 56 % of centers, respectively, whereas ≤ 5 wireless capsule endoscopies per trainee per year by 75 %.

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was found in 11% of the general population worldwide. The current pharmacologic management of IBS was unsatisfactory, and it was accompanied by a number of adverse events. Melatonin was found to play an important role in gastrointestinal smooth muscle motility. Dysregulation of endogenous melatonin secretion has been found in IBS patients. Exogenous melatonin supplement has become one alternative treatment for IBS, but the evidence is inconclusive. The current meta-analysis sought to determine the efficacy of exogenous melatonin supplement in improving IBS severity in IBS patients. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the efficacy of exogenous melatonin supplement in ameliorating IBS severity in IBS patients. This meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. The primary target outcomes were changes in IBS severity associated with melatonin or placebo. This meta-analysis of 4 RCTs and 115 participants revealed that exogenous melatonin supplement was associated with significantly better improvement in overall IBS severity than placebo (k = 4, Hedges' g = 0.746, 95% confidence intervals = 0.401-1.091, p < 0.001). The subgroup without concurrent medication had the same result (p < 0.001). In addition, exogenous melatonin supplement was also associated with significantly better improvement in IBS pain severity (p < 0.001) and quality of life (p = 0.007) than placebo, but not in abdominal distension (p = 0.111) or sleep quality (p = 0.142). Finally, melatonin was associated with similar safety profiles with placebo. This meta-analysis provides evidence for the use of exogenous melatonin in IBS patients to ameliorate overall IBS severity, IBS pain severity, and quality of life. PROSPERO CRD42021269451.",

Mortality risks were further increased in colonic diverticular disease patients with a colorectal biopsy showing any mucosal inflammation HR 1.36; (95%CI 1.33-1.38), with the most significant increase during the first year after diagnosis HR 2.18; (95%CI 2.05-2.32). Mortality in colonic diverticular disease is increased over reference individuals in the general population. The presence of mucosal inflammation on colorectal biopsies is a predictor of increased risk of mortality.",

        "Title": "Monitoring the effect of TNF-alpha inhibitors on laboratory parameters and adverse effects in different diseases: a retrospective, single-center study.",
        "Abstract": "The introduction of biological treatments has revolutionized the management of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Multiple clinical trials have established the efficacy of biological agents in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Nevertheless, there are no clear indications for optimal monitoring intervals during treatment. Collect and analyze laboratory evaluation data from patients receiving biological therapy to provide a better understanding of the need for laboratory investigations before and during treatment with biological agents, and to analyze adverse events and other factors. Retrospective cohort SETTINGS: Tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from the electronic medical records of patients attending the dermatology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology clinics from June 2014 to June 2019. The laboratory parameters of patients who have received one of the TNF-alpha inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab) were collected starting at baseline and up to at least one year from treatment initiation. The time points at which patients developed significantly abnormal laboratory results during treatment with one of the TNF-alpha inhibitors. 250 patients RESULTS: Most patients were treated with adalimumab (38.4%); a similar proportion (38%) with infliximab, whereas only 23.6% were treated with etanercept. The majority of the significant abnormal laboratory results occurred at baseline, 3-6 and 9-12 months. Most abnormalities were among patients using infliximab, followed by etanercept, and then adalimumab. The median number of laboratory abnormalities for dermatology patients was significantly lower than that for gastroenterology patients (<i>P</i><.001), and for rheumatology patients (<i>P</i>=.002). Because dermatology patients showed a lower median number of laboratory abnormalities than patients treated by other specialties in our study, we believe that dermatology patients require less frequent laboratory monitoring. Therefore, we recommend laboratory evaluation at baseline, after 3-6 months, 1 year from the beginning of treatment, and annually thereafter for patients using TNF-alpha inhibitor agents. However, more frequent testing might be warranted according to patient comorbidities, concomitant medications, and physician judgment. Single center and retrospective design. None.",

        "Abstract": "The approval and adoption of biosimilar products are essential to contain increasing healthcare costs and provide more affordable choices for patients. Despite steady progress in the number of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) biosimilar approvals over the years, biosimilar adoption in the United States has been slow and gradual, largely driven by payers rather than clinicians. In order to better understand the barriers to biosimilar adoption in the clinic, the University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI) and the FDA jointly hosted a virtual workshop on April 13, 2022, titled \"Biosimilars: A Decade of Experience and Future Directions - Strategies for Improving Biosimilar Adoption and the Potential Role of Clinical Pharmacology.\" This summary documents the experiences of four leading academic clinicians with specialties in oncology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, and endocrinology and their perspectives on how to increase biosimilar adoption, including the role of clinical pharmacology. Besides systemic changes in pricing and reimbursement, there is a need for additional education of a broad range of providers, including advanced care practitioners, and patients themselves. Educational efforts highlighting the rigor of the studies that support the approval of biosimilars-including the clinical pharmacology studies-and the benefits of biosimilars, can play a major role in improving biosimilar acceptance.",

        "Abstract": "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare complication of solid organ transplantation as the result of immunosuppressant medications. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in most of these cases, specifically with B-cell predominant lymphoma. This case report describes a 24-year-old female who presented with recurrent GI bleed within 6 months post-orthostatic heart transplant. Endoscopic evaluations including video capsule study, push enteroscopy, and colonoscopy revealed multiple ulcerated lesions in duodenum, jejunum, and colon secondary to Epstein-Barr Virus-associated monomorphic PTLD. Despite continuation of rituximab after discharge, she returned to the hospital for recurrent GI bleed requiring additional endoscopic intervention. PTLD is a devastating disease of the post-transplant population. Due to a high risk of recurrent GI bleeding, patients with PTLD may benefit from careful monitoring by gastroenterology as an outpatient with a low threshold for repeat endoscopic evaluation despite being on immunotherapy or chemotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "To evaluate the usefulness of gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire (GerdQ) and reflux symptom index (RSI) for diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients with suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms (cough, hoarseness, globus, and throat pain). A total of 98 patients with LPR symptoms were incorporated from either gastroenterology or otorhinolaryngology clinic. Patient's laryngoscopic findings were graded by reflux finding score (RFS), and RFS ≥ 7 was considered as positive LPR. Erosive esophagitis on endoscopy or abnormal results on ambulatory impedance-pH monitoring were used as diagnostic criteria for GERD. Esophageal motor function was evaluated using high-resolution esophageal manometry. Ninety-three (94.9%) of the 98 subjects were diagnosed as LPR by RFS, but only 15 (15.3%) had GERD. For GerdQ, the cutoff value of 9 showed the highest area under curve (AUC) to diagnose GERD by receiver operating curve analysis (AUC = 0.565); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were unsatisfactory (50.0%, 70.7%, 22.6%, and 89.2%, respectively.) RSI also showed poor performance in diagnosing GERD; the cutoff value of 25 showed the highest yield (AUC = 0.581); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 42.9%, 79.3%, 26.1%, and 89.0%, respectively. Ineffective esophageal motility was frequently observed (69 of 98, 70.4%), but there was no difference in esophageal motility parameters between GERD and non-GERD patients. In patients with LPR symptoms, significant discrepancies are observed between laryngoscopic diagnosis and GERD. In this population, neither GerdQ nor RSI is useful in diagnosing GERD.",

        "Abstract": "Compared with other medical specialties, there are lower numbers of female trainees and lower rates of flexible working in gastroenterology. This study aims to examine the experience of male and female trainees to understand specialty demographics and the experience of training. Gastroenterology training data were obtained from the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) trainee surveys from 2014, 2018 and 2020, and from the Royal College of Physicians Medical Workforce unit between 2011 and 2019. Data on endoscopy measures from 2011 to 2021 were obtained from the Joint Advisory Group (JAG) on gastrointestinal endoscopy, including the JAG Endoscopy training system and the National Endoscopy Database. Data were segregated and compared by gender. The percentage of female gastroenterology trainees remains at around 40%, largely unchanged over the previous decade. From the BSG trainee survey, 29.5% of women have flexible working patterns compared with 2.6% of men (p<0.001), which is lower than other medical specialties. Less than half of female trainees felt confident about their job prospects once they qualify. A greater proportion of male than female trainees achieved provisional colonoscopy certification during training (55% vs 45%, p=0.005) and female trainees took longer to certify than male trainees (63 months vs 56 months, p=0.004). The total length of training time from primary medical qualification to consultancy was the same for men and women. Changes must be addressed from a national and institutional level to address equitable access to national training programmes and equality of outcome for male and female trainees.",

        "Abstract": "Small bowel ultrasound has very good diagnostic accuracy for disease extent, presence and activity in Crohn's Disease, is well tolerated by patients and is cheaper when compared with MRI. However, uptake of ultrasound in the UK is limited. An online survey to assess the current usage of ultrasound throughout the UK was undertaken by BSG IBD group members between 9/06/2021- 25/06/2021. Responses were anonymous. 103 responses were included in the data analysis. Responses came from 66 different NHS trusts from 14 different regions of the UK. All respondents reported that they currently have an MRI service for Crohn's disease, whereas only 31 had an ultrasound service. Average time for results to be reported for MRI scans was reported as between 4- and 6 weeks, with a range of 2 days to 28 weeks. The average time for an ultrasound to be reported was stated as 1-4 weeks, with a range of 0-8 weeks. There was disparity between the reported confidence of clinicians making clinical decisions when using ultrasound compared to MRI. Of those respondents who did not have access to an ultrasound service, 72 stated that they would be interested in developing an ultrasound service. There is an appetite for the uptake of ultrasound in the UK for assessment of Crohn's disease, however, there remains a significant number of UK centres with little or no access to an ultrasound service. Further research is necessary to understand why this is the case.",

        "Abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a disorder resulting from the retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus, affects an estimated 10-30% of the Western population, which is characterized by multifactorial pathogenesis. Over the past few decades, there have been many aspects of uncertainty regarding GERD leading to an ongoing interest in the field as reflected by a large number of publications, whose heterogeneity and variable quality may present a challenge for researchers to measure their scientific impact, identify scientific collaborations, and to grasp actively researched themes in the GERD field. Accordingly, we aim to evaluate the knowledge structure, evolution of research themes, and emerging topics of GERD research between 2012 and 2022 with the help of bibliometric approaches. The literature focusing on GERD from 2012 to 2022 was retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection. The overall publication performance, the most prolific countries or regions, authors, journals and resources-, knowledge- and intellectual-networking, as well as the co-citation analysis of references and keywords, were analyzed through Microsoft Office Excel 2019, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer. A total of 8,964 publications were included in the study. The USA published the most articles (3,204, 35.74%). Mayo Clin ranked first in the number of articles published (201, 2.24%). EDOARDO SAVARINO was the most productive author (86, 0.96%). The most productive journal in this field was <i>SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES</i> (304, 3.39%). <i>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY</i> had the most co-citations (4,953, 3.30%). Keywords with the ongoing strong citation bursts were transoral incision less fundoplication, eosinophilic esophagitis, baseline impedance, and functional heartburn. For the first time, we obtained deep insights into GERD research through bibliometric analysis. Findings in this study will be helpful for scholars seeking to understand essential information in this field and identify research frontiers.",

        "Abstract": "Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare non-hereditary disease with a poor prognosis and a mortality rate of up to 55%. Currently, there is no standard treatment for CCS. The department of gastroenterology of our hospital admitted a patient with CCS whose symptoms improved significantly after treatment with thalidomide combined with endoscopy, and there was no obvious adverse reaction during the 2-year follow-up. A 47-year-old Chinese man presented with diarrhea for more than 4 mo, accompanied by loss of taste, fatigue, and weight loss. Physical examination demonstrated that the patient's skin and hands were hyperpigmented, the front edges of the nails of both hands were notably thickened and yellow, and the nails were partially atrophied. Gastrointestinal endoscopy identified a diffuse polypoid bulge, and the patient bore an albumin level of 27.3 g/L. The level of the calcium correction amount was (2.164 mM) which allowed for a comprehensive diagnosis of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome, combined with hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia. Thalidomide of 150 mg per day was administered to regulate immunity, and the symptoms were relieved after 1 wk. During the follow-up period, polyps were still found that had not been resolved by thalidomide treatment, and endoscopic therapy was performed. This resulted in further improvement of his condition and no particular discomfort during the 2 years of follow-up. The patient's symptoms were significantly relieved by thalidomide 2 years after treatment, proposing it as a potential treatment for CCS.",

        "Abstract": "Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is often underestimated in clinical diagnosis. Gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis of PHG accounts for approximately 10% of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the relationship between PHG and gender, laboratory parameters, liver function and varices is still controversial. In the present study, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of PHG and to explore the relationship between PHG and gender, laboratory parameters, liver function and varicose veins. A retrospective analysis of 325 patients with cirrhosis who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the Department of Gastroenterology of the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020 was performed. The relationships among age, gender, laboratory parameters, Child-Pugh stage, oesophageal varices (EV), gastric varices (GV) and ascites with PHG were analysed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The occurrence of PHG was significantly associated with gender, haemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time, albumin, Child-Pugh stage, EV, GV and ascites (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the severity of PHG and the degree of EV, GV and ascites (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that albumin, EV and GV levels were independently associated with the occurrence of PHG. The incidence of PHG in cirrhosis was 87.4% in this study. The occurrence of PHG was related to gender, haemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time, albumin, Child-Pugh stage, EV, GV and ascites. Albumin, the degree of EV and GV are independent risk factors for the occurrence of PHG.",

The aim was to compare the effectiveness of ustekinumab and vedolizumab for treatment of EIM in IBD. We included IBD patients treated with vedolizumab or ustekinumab in the Gastroenterology department, Sheba Medical Center, for up to 52 weeks between 2015 and 2021. Patients with active EIM before treatment initiation were included. 111 patients were included. 53 patients (48%) were treated with ustekinumab; 88% (n-99) had CD. The most common EIM was arthralgia (95/111, 84%). Patients treated with ustekinumab were more likely to be anti-TNF experienced (n-51/53 [96%] compared with vedolizumab n = 36/58 [62%], p < 0.001).

        "Abstract": "In the setting of increasing attention to representation in medicine, we aimed to assess current perspectives of racial and ethnic workforce diversity and health care disparities among gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology professionals in the United States. We developed and administered a 33-item electronic cross-sectional survey to members of 5 national GI and hepatology societies. Survey items were organized into thematic modules and solicited perspectives on racial and ethnic workforce diversity, health care disparities in GI and hepatology, and potential interventions to enhance workforce diversity and improve health equity. Of the 1219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]). Suggested interventions were to increase career mentorship opportunities (n = 545 [44.7%]), medical student opportunities (n = 520 [42.7%]), and program and professional society leadership roles for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups (n = 473 [38.8%]). Our survey explored imperative and timely perspectives on racial and ethnic representation and health equity among professionals in GI and hepatology. The findings should inform future interventions to address workforce diversity and establish priorities toward improving health equity, ultimately serving as a springboard for professional societies, academic institutions, and other organizations that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.",

        "Abstract": "C1-inhibitor deficiency is a rare disease which incorporates acute self-limiting intermittent swelling of the subcutaneous tissue and mucous membranes. Attacks most frequently affect the face and/or the upper airway. Isolated angioedema of the small bowel is an uncommon manifestation and often accompanied by diagnostic delay. In the present case, abdominal pain turned out to be the first and only utterance of an acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, secondary to a splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Imaging showed wall thickening of the small intestine, ascites and splenomegaly. The abdominal pain and intestinal wall thickening with surrounding ascites on imaging spontaneously resolved each episode within 2-3 days. Gastrointestinal manifestations of angioedema may mimic an acute abdomen, and subsequently one-third of these patients undergo unnecessary surgery prior to a definite diagnosis. This emphasises the importance of considering the diagnosis in case of an 'extraordinary colic'.",

        "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) infection is the main bacterial cause of several gastrointestinal disorders. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of H. pylori infection in a population of Bahraini adults seeking care in gastroenterology clinics in a tertiary care hospital in the Kingdom of Bahrain and examine the association between dietary habits and other factors with H. pylori infection. The study is a hospital-based retrospective, cross-sectional analytical study that included 200 participants. H. pylori infection prevalence among the studied group was 55.5%, and it was significantly higher among participants with a high school education or less (44.1%). Among dietary habits, the mean of frequency of green tea, coffee and honey intake was significantly lower among the H. pylori infected participants compared to their non-infected counterparts. H. pylori infection was significantly higher among participants with vitamin D deficiency (63.6%) compared to participants with normal vitamin D (30%) (p = 0.001) and each unit decrease in serum vitamin D was associated with an increased risk of infection by 1.1 times (OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.18; p < 0.001). The study revealed that high educational levels, consumption of honey, green tea, and coffee, as well as normal serum vitamin D level, were independent protectors against H. pylori infection. Additional studies are needed to estimate the prevalence and predisposing factors of H. pylori infection in the general population.",

        "Abstract": "The worldwide incidence of allergic diseases has been continuously increasing, and up to one in every five people are currently affected by these medical conditions. Although seldom fatal, allergies have a profound impact on children's growth, development, and quality of life, besides being associated with heavy healthcare costs and resource utilisation. In this context, a group of experts in nutrition, paediatric gastroenterology, allergology, and neonatology joined forces to discuss the role of infant formulas in the primary prevention of allergies in infants for whom breastfeeding is not an option and who are at risk of developing allergies. The topics discussed included the assessment of risk, the impact of the microbiota on the modulation of immune tolerance, and the added value of certain formula characteristics, namely, protein integrity (hydrolysed protein vs. intact protein) and the addition of prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics. This article describes the latest evidence on each of the above-mentioned points, as well as a number of recommendations made by the experts to guide counselling of parents in the choice of a formula for infants at risk of allergy. Overall, the experts highlighted family history and dysbiosis-promoting factors (namely, caesarean delivery and antibiotic use) as two of the most important risk factors for allergy development. Moreover, in line with international guidelines, the panel advocated that intact protein formula should be offered to all bottle-fed healthy infants, irrespective of their allergic risk (with the exception of short-term bottle feeding of otherwise breastfed babies in their first week of life, for whom a hydrolysed formula may be advisable). Finally, the experts agreed that the use of prebiotic-, probiotic-, or synbiotic-enriched formulas should be considered in infants at risk of developing allergies.",

        "Abstract": "GI endoscopy is highly resource-intensive with a significant contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and waste generation. Sustainable endoscopy in the context of climate change is now the focus of mainstream discussions between endoscopy providers, units and professional societies. In addition to broader global challenges, there are some specific measures relevant to endoscopy units and their practices, which could significantly reduce environmental impact. Awareness of these issues and guidance on practical interventions to mitigate the carbon footprint of GI endoscopy are lacking. In this consensus, we discuss practical measures to reduce the impact of endoscopy on the environment applicable to endoscopy units and practitioners.

        "Abstract": "Benefits of behavioral health (BH) integrated care (IC) in pediatric primary care have been demonstrated (Asarnow et al., 2015). Pediatric subspecialty care treats patients with high levels of medical and psychosocial vulnerability and complexity (Samsel et al., 2017), underscoring the need for increased IC. Medical provider satisfaction (MPS) with IC is highly relevant for the utilization and expansion of these services. The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine MPS related to BH IC services in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Eight pediatric gastroenterology providers working in an outpatient clinic completed a 32-item survey (adapted from Corso et al., 2016) assessing their satisfaction with integrated BH care services. Descriptive statistics were utilized to examine and summarize provider satisfaction data. Pediatric gastroenterology medical providers reported high levels of satisfaction with existing IC services and a preference for embedded versus colocated IC. They perceived provider-related and clinical benefits of IC, felt that addressing BH issues is important, and believed IC is a valued service. Medical providers expressed that they wanted expanded IC services, including an embedded psychologist at more locations, BH screenings for younger patients, and an electronic psychosocial screening process. The results of this study align with research findings regarding high medical provider satisfaction with IC in primary care and a preference for embedded BH services (Asarnow et al., 2015). While this preliminary study is small in scale, it is an important initial step to better understand MPS with IC in pediatric subspecialty care.

Diagnosis of Bouveret's syndrome necessitates urgent treatment as it carries a high mortality rate. The treatment of Bouveret's syndrome has traditionally been surgical. However, there have been increasing reports of successful endoscopic therapy for Bouveret's syndrome. This case series aims to compare and contrast two cases of Bouveret's syndrome. The gallstone was retrieved via endoscopic access in one case while the other was removed with surgery. For each case, we discuss the various factors that contributed to the decision of which treatment modality to use. In addition, we propose an endoscopic technique that may improve the safety and success rate of endoscopic treatment of Bouveret's syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, associated with adverse health consequences that may adversely influence physical activity and body composition in youth. These effects may lead to changes in physical fitness, which is positively associated with health-related outcomes. The aim is to assess health-related physical fitness levels in paediatric patients with IBD and to compare these levels with those in healthy matched controls. This trial is a bicentric case-control study. Fifty paediatric patients with IBD and 50 matched healthy controls will be recruited (1:1), and physical fitness levels (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, speed/agility and flexibility) will be assessed. The primary outcome is cardiorespiratory fitness, which will be compared between children and adolescents with IBD and healthy controls matched for age, sex and body mass index class. We will assess whether the two groups differ with respect to other physical fitness components and cardiovascular risk in adulthood according to sex-specific cut-offs for a healthy cardiorespiratory fitness level in adolescents. We will identify relationships between physical fitness and characteristics of IBD, quality of life and daily physical activity. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes, Centre-Ouest I, Tours, France; No 2019-A02651-56) and was declared to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés. All procedures will be performed according to the ethical standards of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2008, and the European Union's Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent will be obtained from the youths and their parents. Research findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and scientific meetings, as well as in social media and IBD family support groups. NCT04647578.",

Of the 1219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]). Suggested interventions were to increase career mentorship opportunities (n = 545 [44.7%]), medical student opportunities (n = 520 [42.7%]), and program and professional society leadership roles for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups (n = 473 [38.8%]). Our survey explored imperative and timely perspectives on racial and ethnic representation and health equity among professionals in GI and hepatology. The findings should inform future interventions to address workforce diversity and establish priorities toward improving health equity, ultimately serving as a springboard for professional societies, academic institutions, and other organizations that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.",

        "Abstract": "Probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host, are widely used despite uncertainty regarding their efficacy and discordant recommendations about their use. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Special Interest Group on Gut Microbiota and Modifications provides updated recommendations for the use of probiotics for the management of selected pediatric gastrointestinal disorders. All systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, as well as subsequently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (until December 2021), that compared the use of probiotics in all delivery vehicles and formulations, at any dose, with no probiotic (ie, placebo or no treatment), were eligible for inclusion. The recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 RCTs on a similar well-defined probiotic strain were available. The modified Delphi process was used to establish consensus on the recommendations. Recommendations for the use of specific probiotic strains were made for the management of acute gastroenteritis, prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis, management of Helicobacter pylori infection, and management of functional abdominal pain disorders and infant colic. Despite evidence to support the use of specific probiotics in some clinical situations, further studies confirming the effect(s) and defining the type, dose, and timing of probiotics are still often required. The use of probiotics with no documented health benefits should be discouraged.",

        "Abstract": "Functional dyspepsia and bloating are common gastrointestinal conditions that frequently lead to gastroenterology referral. Both disorders have a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life and the healthcare system. The purpose of this review is to highlight important new findings in the cause, pathophysiology and treatment of these two disorders. Confocal laser endomicroscopy identified changes in epithelial barrier structure and function, providing important insights into the development of functional dyspepsia symptoms when combined with new observations of localized duodenal inflammation. Changes in the gut microbiome may be responsible for functional dyspepsia symptoms in some patients and may respond to gut-selective antibiotics. New data from the NIH-sponsored Gastroparesis Consortium confirmed that functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis are not distinct disorders but rather exist on a spectrum. Virtual reality may be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. A novel questionnaire was developed and validated to assess symptoms, prevalence and impact in patients with bloating and distension. A meta-analysis identified medications to treat symptoms of bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia and bloating are leading to important changes in medical therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Private equity acquisitions of physician practices in the US have been increasing rapidly; however, the implications for health care delivery and spending are unclear. To examine changes in prices and utilization associated with private equity acquisitions of physician practices across multiple specialties. This was a difference-in-differences event study of US physician practices specialized in dermatology, gastroenterology, and ophthalmology that were acquired by private equity firms from 2016 to 2020. Within each specialty, each private equity-acquired (PE-acquired) practice was matched with as many as 5 control practices based on the preacquisition number of unique patients, encounters, risk score, share of services billed out-of-network, and spending. The PE-acquired practices were compared with matched controls through year 2 after acquisition, using a difference-in-differences event study. Data analyses were performed from March 2021 to February 2022. Private equity acquisition of physician practices. Measures of spending and utilization, including the charge and price (amount paid) per claim, new and unique patients, and total encounters. Compared with the 2874 control practices, the 578 PE-acquired physician practices exhibited an average increase of $71 (+20.2%) charged per claim (95% CI, 13.1%-27.3%; P < .001) and $23 (+11.0%) in the allowed amount per claim (95% CI, 5.6%-16.5%; P < .001). The PE-acquired practices increased their numbers of unique patients seen by 25.8% (95% CI, 15.8%-35.6%; P < .001) compared with control practices, driven by a 37.9% increase in visits by new patients (95% CI, 25.6%-50.2%; P < .001). In aggregate, their volume of encounters increased by 16.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-32.0%; P = .04) compared with the control group, with a 9.4% increase in the share of office visits for established patients that were billed as longer than 30 minutes (95% CI, 1.7%-17.0%; P = .02). No statistically significant changes in patient risk scores were found between PE-acquired practices and controls. Within specialties, we found modest differences along selected outcomes. In this difference-in-differences study, private equity acquisition of physician practices in dermatology, gastroenterology, and ophthalmology were associated with differential increases in allowed amount and charges per claim, volume of encounters, and new patients seen, as well as some changes in billing and coding.",

        "Abstract": "In patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), antimicrobial therapy with oral vancomycin (OV) is increasingly used to prevent progression of the liver disease and control concomitant ulcerative colitis (UC); however, there are concerns regarding the risk of development of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Thus, we aimed to determine the incidence of VRE in PSC-UC patients. We conducted a retrospective study of PSC-UC patients, treated with OV at the Department of Gastroenterology at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. VRE testing was performed utilizing rectal swabs. We included 7 PSC-UC patients (age 22-53 years, 2 females) treated with OV with daily dose ranging from 250 to 1500 mg. All patients were treated for at least 6 months with OV (range 9-31 months, mean 32.1 months). All patients achieved complete clinical remission of the UC, with mean reduction of fecal calprotectin by 634 μg/mg (87.3%), mean reduction in the C-reactive protein by 21.9 mg/L (74.2%), and mean reduction in the total Mayo score by 9.3 (93.3%). With regard to the liver parameters, mean improvement in alkaline phosphatase enzyme and total bilirubin was -48.7 U/L (-19.7%) and -2.7 mg/dL (-19.6%), respectively. No patient treated with OV developed VRE or reported any adverse events. This cohort study including PSC-UC patients did not provide evidence for development of VRE, while treatment with vancomycin was associated with clinical and endoscopic remission of the UC. Larger, prospective trials are required to define the efficacy and safety of antimicrobial therapy in PSC-UC, while the risk of VRE appears small.",

        "Abstract": "Decades of research demonstrate the value of workplace diversity. Reports from individual countries show that women are underrepresented in internal medicine workforces. However, large pooled international studies are not available. This study investigates the current representation of women in the internal medicine workforce internationally and identifies specialties in which underrepresentation is evident. Peer-reviewed studies, government reports, and medical association reports were used to determine proportions of specialists and doctors training in internal medical specialties and in comparator surgical specialties. Data were available from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, the United States, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A total of 380,263 doctors were studied, including 268,822 practicing specialist physicians (also known as attendings or consultants) and 53,226 doctors in internal medicine specialty training programs (also known as residents, fellows, advanced trainees, or specialist registrar trainees). Among practicing physician specialists, the rate of representation of women was 35% (95,195/268,822, p <0.001). Among trainees, the rate of representation of women was 43% (22,728/53,226, p <0.001). Among physician specialties evaluated, cardiology (15%, 4,152 of 27,328), gastroenterology (20%, 3,765 of 18,893), and respiratory/critical care (24%, 5,255 of 21,870) had the lowest representations of women compared with men (p <0.001 for all). Cardiology and particularly the subspecialty of interventional cardiology were clear outliers as the internal medicine specialties with the lowest representation of women at practicing specialist and trainee levels. In conclusion, this study is the largest international study of women in internal medicine specialties. It found that cardiology, gastroenterology, and respiratory/critical care specialties have the most substantial underrepresentation of women. These data are a global call to action to establish more successful strategies to provide a diverse and representative cardiology workforce.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal epithelial integrity is commonly disrupted in patients with critical disorders, but the exact underlying mechanisms are unclear. Long noncoding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) control different cell functions and are involved in pathologies. Here, we investigated the role of T-UCRs in intestinal epithelial homeostasis and identified T-UCR uc.230 as a major regulator of epithelial renewal, apoptosis, and barrier function. Compared with controls, intestinal mucosal tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis and from mice with colitis or fasted for 48 hours had increased levels of uc.230. Silencing uc.230 inhibited the growth of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and organoids and caused epithelial barrier dysfunction. Silencing uc.230 also increased IEC vulnerability to apoptosis, whereas increasing uc.230 levels protected IECs against cell death. In mice with colitis, reduced uc.230 levels enhanced mucosal inflammatory injury and delayed recovery. Mechanistic studies revealed that uc.230 increased CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) by acting as a natural decoy RNA for miR-503, which interacts with Cugbp1 mRNA and represses its translation. These findings indicate that uc.230 sustains intestinal mucosal homeostasis by promoting epithelial renewal and barrier function and that it protects IECs against apoptosis by serving as a natural sponge for miR-503, thereby preserving CUGBP1 expression.",

Our survey aims to investigate how the pandemic has continued to affect job search and attainment for pediatric gastroenterology fellows as well as to re-evaluate the pandemic's impact on pediatric gastroenterology fellow educational experiences. An anonymous survey was distributed to all North American pediatric gastroenterology fellows from May to June 2021. Survey questions included topics related to job search and fellowship training and were tailored to respondent year of training. Of 453 pediatric gastroenterology fellows in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, 158 fellows (35%) responded to the survey. Of graduating fellow respondents with job contracts, 74% reported willingness to make compromises in their job search, 76% reported accepting academic positions that were primary clinical, and 42% estimated staying at their accepted job for less than 5 years. When asked about the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of fellowship education, a negative impact was reported in the following areas: 76% in research, 94% in clinical experience, 73% in procedural skills, and 84% in didactics. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to make a significant impact on pediatric gastroenterology fellowship education and the job attainment process. Regarding accepted job positions, we found substantial willingness to compromise, a shorter duration to stay at the job than expected, and minimal research focus. This raises concern regarding job preparedness and satisfaction as fellows complete their medical training.",

        "Abstract": "Variants in thiopurine methyltransferase (<i>TPMT</i>) and nudix hydrolase 15 (<i>NUDT15</i>) are associated with an accumulation of cytotoxic metabolites leading to increased risk of drug-related toxicity with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. We established <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> genetic testing for clinical use and evaluated the utilization, service outcomes and potential value of multi-gene PGx testing for 210 patients that underwent pharmacogenetics (PGx) testing for thiopurine therapy with the aim to optimize service delivery for future prescribing. The test was most commonly ordered for Gastroenterology (40.0%) and Neurology (31.4%), with an average turnaround time of 2 days. Following testing, 24.3% patients were identified as intermediate or poor metabolizers, resulting in 51 recommendations for a drug or dose change in thiopurine therapy, which were implemented in 28 (54.9%) patients. In the remaining patients, 14 were not adjusted and 9 had no data available. Focusing on drug gene interactions available for testing in our laboratory, multi-gene PGx results would present opportunities for treatment optimization for at least 33.8% of these patients who were on 2 or more concurrent medications with actionable PGx guidance. However, the use of PGx panel testing in clinical practice will require the development of guidelines and education as revealed by a survey with the test providers. The evaluation demonstrated successful implementation of single gene PGx testing and this experience guides the transition to a pre-emptive multi-gene testing approach that provides the opportunity to improve clinical care.",

However, previous studies have been retrospective or single institutional experiences. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate NGS on a multi-institutional cohort of patients with pancreatic cyst in real time. The performance of a 22-gene NGS panel (PancreaSeq) was first retrospectively confirmed and then within a 2-year timeframe, PancreaSeq testing was prospectively used to evaluate endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration pancreatic cyst fluid from 31 institutions. PancreaSeq results were correlated with endoscopic ultrasound findings, ancillary studies, current pancreatic cyst guidelines, follow-up, and expanded testing (Oncomine) of postoperative specimens. Among 1933 PCs prospectively tested, 1887 (98%) specimens from 1832 patients were satisfactory for PancreaSeq testing. Follow-up was available for 1216 (66%) patients (median, 23 months). Based on 251 (21%) patients with surgical pathology, mitogen-activated protein kinase/GNAS mutations had 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity for a mucinous cyst (positive predictive value [PPV], 100%; negative predictive value [NPV], 77%). On exclusion of low-level variants, the combination of mitogen-activated protein kinase/GNAS and TP53/SMAD4/CTNNB1/mammalian target of rapamycin alterations had 88% sensitivity and 98% specificity for advanced neoplasia (PPV, 97%; NPV, 93%). Inclusion of cytopathologic evaluation to PancreaSeq testing improved the sensitivity to 93% and maintained a high specificity of 95% (PPV, 92%; NPV, 95%). In comparison, other modalities and current pancreatic cyst guidelines, such as the American Gastroenterology Association and International Association of Pancreatology/Fukuoka guidelines, show inferior diagnostic performance. The sensitivities and specificities of VHL and MEN1/loss of heterozygosity alterations were 71% and 100% for serous cystadenomas (PPV, 100%; NPV, 98%), and 68% and 98% for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PPV, 85%; NPV, 95%), respectively. On follow-up, serous cystadenomas with TP53/TERT mutations exhibited interval growth, whereas pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with loss of heterozygosity of ≥3 genes tended to have distant metastasis. None of the 965 patients who did not undergo surgery developed malignancy. Postoperative Oncomine testing identified mucinous cysts with BRAF fusions and ERBB2 amplification, and advanced neoplasia with CDKN2A alterations. PancreaSeq was not only sensitive and specific for various pancreatic cyst types and advanced neoplasia arising from mucinous cysts, but also reveals the diversity of genomic alterations seen in pancreatic cysts and their clinical significance.",

        "Abstract": "Liver cirrhosis is a major global health burden worldwide due to its high risk of morbidity and mortality. Role of terlipressin for the management of liver cirrhosis related complications has been recognized during recent years. This paper aims to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidance on the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis related complications. Hepatobiliary Study Group of Chinese Society of Gastroenterology of Chinese Medical Association and Hepatology Committee of Chinese Research Hospital Association have invited gastroenterologists, hepatologists, infectious disease specialists, surgeons, and clinical pharmacists to formulate the clinical practice guidance based on comprehensive literature review and experts' clinical experiences. Overall, 10 major statements regarding efficacy and safety of terlipressin in liver cirrhosis were proposed. Terlipressin can be beneficial for the management of cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). However, the evidence regarding the use of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with ascites, post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, and bacterial infections and in those undergoing hepatic resection and liver transplantation remains insufficient. Terlipressin-related adverse events, mainly including gastrointestinal symptoms, electrolyte disturbance, and cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events, should be closely monitored. The current clinical practice guidance supports the use of terlipressin for gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and HRS in liver cirrhosis. High-quality studies are needed to further clarify its potential effects in other liver cirrhosis related complications.",

        "Abstract": "To determine the factors affecting the procalcitonin level, and its association with the severity of pancreatitis in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). Cross-sectional analytical study. Division of Gastroenterology, University of Health Sciences, Diyarbakır Gazi Yasargil Education and Research Hospital and Department of Gastroenterology, Dicle University School of Medicine, Diyarbakır, Turkey, between April 2017 and June 2021. The study included 214 patients diagnosed with AP according to Atlanta criteria. By checking the PCT and CRP values of the patients in the first 12 hours, the relationship with these scales that predict the severity of pancreatitis was statistically examined. Hundred and fifty-two patients (71.0%) had mild, while 62 patients (29.0%) had severe pancreatitis. According to the Atlanta criteria, the mean PCT level of patients with mild pancreatitis was 1.4±0.7 ng/mL, while the mean PCT level of patients with severe pancreatitis was 9.0±12.3 ng/mL (p<0.001). The diagnostic performance of PCT was better for predicting severe AP. For the 0.94 ng/mL cut-off, PCT had 86.9% sensitivity and 50.7% specificity. (AUC=0.731[95% CI: 0.669-0.811]; p<0.001; LR: 1.7). In patients with severe pancreatitis, the PCT level was 4.7±18.5 ng/mL in patients without concomitant infection and 15.8±8.1 ng/mL in patients with concomitant infection (p<0.001). High PCT value measured at the time of the first admission to the hospital may predict severe pancreatitis. In addition, a high PCT value at the time of admission to the hospital in patients with pancreatitis may indicate another concomitant infection.

        "Abstract": "The eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori globally are decreasing with a dramatic increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria all over the world, including Saudi Arabia. There is no current consensus on the management of H. pylori in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Gastroenterology Association developed these practice guidelines after reviewing the local and regional studies on the management of H. pylori. The aim was to establish recommendations to guide healthcare providers in managing H. pylori in Saudi Arabia. Experts in the areas of H. pylori management and microbiology were invited to write these guidelines. A literature search was performed, and all authors participated in writing and reviewing the guidelines. In addition, international guidelines and consensus reports were reviewed to bridge the gap in knowledge when local and regional data were unavailable. There is limited local data on treatment of H. pylori. The rate of clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance is high; therefore, standard triple therapy for 10-14 days is no longer recommended in the treatment of H. pylori unless antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. Based on the available data, bismuth quadruple therapy for 10-14 days is considered the best first-line and second-line therapy. Culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be considered following two treatment failures. These recommendations are intended to provide the most relevant evidence-based guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection in Saudi Arabia. The working group recommends further studies to explore more therapeutic options to eradicate H. pylori.",

To determine the prevalence of PPI use and indications, describe its pattern of usage, and identify factors associated with inappropriate prescriptions at a federal tertiary teaching hospital in Maiduguri, Nigeria. PPI prescriptions were retrospectively assessed in the General Outpatients' Department (GOPD) and Gastroenterology Unit (GITU) of a teaching hospital. Relevant data for the study were extracted from the patients' medical records. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests where appropriate were used to identify factors associated with inappropriate PPI prescriptions. A <i>p</i> < 0.05 was considered to be significant. PPIs were prescribed to 73.3% (220/300) of patients, while inappropriate prescriptions were noted in 91.4% (201/220) of these patients. Epigastric pain (49.5%) was the most common PPI indication, while omeprazole was the highest prescribed (53.4%). Nearly all inpatients (98.2%), those with epigastric pain (95.7%), and patients who were prescribed intravenous PPIs had more inappropriate PPI prescriptions compared to others. This study revealed a high prevalence of PPI use and inappropriate prescriptions at the study hospital. As a result, these findings highlight the importance PPI-based stewardship program at the study hospital.",

Although several advances have been made to achieve diagnostic and therapeutic goals, including double-balloon enteroscopy, single-balloon enteroscopy, and spiral enteroscopy, video capsule endoscopy (VCE) remains the least invasive tool for complete visualization of the small bowel and is the preferred method for initial diagnostic evaluation. At present, interpretation of VCE data requires manual annotation of landmarks and abnormalities in recorded videos, which can be time consuming. Computer-assisted diagnostic systems using artificial intelligence may help to optimize VCE reading efficiency by reducing the need for manual annotation. Here we present a large VCE data set compiled from studies performed at two United States hospitals in Providence, Rhode Island, including 424 VCE studies and 5,247,588 total labeled images. In conjunction with existing published data sets, these files may aid in the development of algorithms to further improve VCE.",

        "Abstract": "Studies evaluating risk factors for the occurrence of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in high-risk regions might contribute to a better understanding of the oesophageal cancer aetiology and incidence variation worldwide. We aimed to quantify the association between alcohol, tobacco and dietary history, and the occurrence of ESCC in Mozambique. A case-control study was conducted at Maputo Central Hospital. Cases (<i>n</i> = 143) were patients with newly diagnosed oesophageal cancer recruited in the Gastroenterology Service. Controls (<i>n</i> = 212) were selected in the Orthopaedic Ward among subjects with pathologies related to trauma. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs), and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using non-conditional logistic regression. The risk of ESCC was higher in older participants and lower in those with higher household income. Alcohol drinking (lifetime consumption ≥ 55.1 versus 0 kg ethanol: OR = 5.56; 95% CI: 2.43-12.73) and tobacco smoking (lifetime consumption ≥ 20 versus 0 pack/years: OR=7.26; 95% CI: 1.42-37.17) were associated with increased risk of ESCC. Tea (at least twice daily versus less than daily: OR = 5.09; 95% CI: 2.45-10.58) was also associated with the occurrence of ESCC. No significant differences were observed for fruit and vegetable and for smoked meat or fish consumption. Findings from this study show that in our sample, the occurrence of ESCC is strongly influenced by lifetime consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and with tea drinking. This highlights the importance of preventive measures based on the promotion of healthier lifestyles.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease with repeated relapses and remissions. Despite decades of effort, numerous aspects, including the initiating event and pathogenesis of UC, still remain ambiguous, which requires ongoing investigation. Given the mass of publications on UC, there are multidimensional challenges to evaluating the scientific impact of relevant work and identifying the current foci of the multifaceted disease. Accordingly, herein, we aim to assess the global growth of UC research production, analyze patterns of research areas, and evaluate trends in this area. <b>Methods:</b> The Web of Science Core Collection of Clarivate Analytics was searched for articles related to UC published from 2011 to 2021. Microsoft Office Excel 2019 was used to visualize the number of publications over time. Knowledge maps were generated using CiteSpace and VOSviewer to analyze collaborations among countries, institutions, and authors and to present the journey of UC research as well as to reveal the current foci of UC research. <b>Results:</b> A total of 5,088 publications were evaluated in the present study. China had the most publications (1,099, 22.5%). Univ Calif San Diego was the most productive institution (126, 2.48%). William J Sandborn published the greatest number of articles (100, 1.97%). Toshifumi Hibi was the most influential author in the field with a betweenness centrality of 0.53. <i>Inflammatory bowel diseases</i> was identified as the most prolific journal (379, 7.45%). <i>Gastroenterology</i> was the most co-cited journal (3,730, 4.02%). \"Vedolizumab,\" \"tofacitinib,\" \"<i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>,\" \"fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT),\" \"toll-like receptor 4,\" and \"nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome\" were considered the hot topics. <b>Conclusion:</b> In UC research, manuscripts that had high impacts on the scientific community provided an evidence base. UC therapy has entered the era of personalized and precision therapy. As research on FMT, anti-integrin antibodies, Janus kinase inhibitors, and anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs continues to grow, their use in the clinical setting may also expand.",

The aim of this study is to assess whether diagnostic, treatment, and outcome measures differ between telemedicine and in-person visits in patients seen in pediatric gastroenterology clinics for the chief complaint of abdominal pain. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients aged 0-22 who underwent their initial pediatric gastroenterology clinic visit, for abdominal pain, between March and September 2020 (n = 1769). The patients were divided into two groups: in-person or telemedicine. Clinical outcome measures were compared from the initial gastroenterology visit and followed for a total of 3 months. There was an increase number of images (M = 0.52 vs. 0.36, <i>p</i> < 0.001), labs (M <i>=</i> 4.87 vs. 4.05; <i>p</i> = 0.001), medications (M <i>=</i> 2.24 vs. 1.67; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and referrals (M <i>=</i> 0.70 vs. 0.54; <i>p</i> < 0.001) performed per visit in the in-person group. Electronic communications (3.97 vs. 5.12 <i>p</i> <0.003) was less frequent after in-person visits. There was no difference in number of procedures (M = 0.128 vs. 0.122, <i>p</i> = 0.718), emergency room visits (M = 0.037 vs. 0.017 <i>p</i> = 0.61), follow-up visits (M = 1.21 vs. 1.21 <i>p</i> = 0.922), or telephone encounters (M = 1.21 vs. 1.12 <i>p</i> = 0.35) between the two groups. Telemedicine utilizes less resources while having comparable outcome measurements in children with a chief complaint of abdominal pain.",

        "Title": "Mobile Apps for the Management of Gastrointestinal Diseases: Systematic Search and Evaluation Within App Stores.",
        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal diseases are associated with substantial cost in health care. In times of the COVID-19 pandemic and further digitalization of gastrointestinal tract health care, mobile health apps could complement routine health care. Many gastrointestinal health care apps are already available in the app stores, but the quality, data protection, and reliability often remain unclear. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the quality characteristics as well as the privacy and security measures of mobile health apps for the management of gastrointestinal diseases. A web crawler systematically searched for mobile health apps with a focus on gastrointestinal diseases. The identified mobile health apps were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Furthermore, app characteristics, data protection, and security measures were collected. Classic user star rating was correlated with overall mobile health app quality. The overall quality of the mobile health apps (N=109) was moderate (mean 2.90, SD 0.52; on a scale ranging from 1 to 5). The quality of the subscales ranged from low (mean 1.89, SD 0.66) to good (mean 4.08, SD 0.57). The security of data transfer was ensured only by 11 (10.1%) mobile health apps. None of the mobile health apps had an evidence base. The user star rating did not correlate with the MARS overall score or with the individual subdimensions of the MARS (all P>.05). Mobile health apps might have a positive impact on diagnosis, therapy, and patient guidance in gastroenterology in the future. We conclude that, to date, data security and proof of efficacy are not yet given in currently available mobile health apps.",

        "Abstract": "Although significant progress relating to professional equality among men and women in medicine has been made over the past few decades, evidence derived from the medical literature suggests that inequity persists with respect to income, attainment of leadership positions, and professional advancement. These inequities have been observed to be more pronounced in gastroenterology. Literature relating to gender-specific barriers to professional equity in gastroenterology is limited. This qualitative study explored perceived barriers to professional equality among women in gastroenterology in Canada through focus groups using a World Café Approach. Several perceived barriers to professional equality were identified. Identification of barriers to professional equality is an important first step to creating meaningful interventions that address the root causes of gender-related inequity in gastroenterology.",

Insight into this topic is important insofar as the multitude of racial, ethnic, and gender backgrounds comprising the national patient population should be reflected, to the degree possible, by the providers serving it. Inclusion becomes particularly imperative because the quality of health care and health research and bridging disparities may be closely linked to adequate representation among healthcare providers. Despite the urgency of this topic, there is a paucity of data examining trends in gender and racial/ethnic diversity among medical professionals within the field of GI. In this narrative review, we examine how ethnoracial and gender representation has changed over time at critical points along the educational, training, and career pathways in GI.",

        "Abstract": "Early palliative and supportive care referral is the standard of care for many malignancies. This paradigm results in improvements in patients' symptoms and quality of life and decreases the costs of medical care and unnecessary procedures. Leading oncology guidelines have recommended the integration of early referral to palliative and supportive services to care pathways for advanced malignancies. Currently, early referral to palliative care within the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) population is not utilized, with gastroenterology guidelines recommending referral of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage D to these services. This review addresses this topic through analysis of the existing data within the oncology field as well as literature surrounding palliative care intervention in HCC. Early palliative and supportive care in HCC and its impact on patients, caregivers, and health services allow clinicians and researchers to identify management options that improve outcomes within existing service provisions.",

        "Abstract": "With the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand and availability of telehealth in outpatient care has had exponential growth. Although use of telehealth has been studied and validated for various medical specialties, relatively few studies have looked at its role in gastroenterology. To assess effectiveness of telehealth medicine in gastroenterology by comparing medication adherence rate for patients seen with telehealth and traditional in-person appointment for various gastrointestinal conditions. Retrospective chart review of patients seen in outpatient gastroenterology clinic was performed to identify patients who were given prescription to fill either through telehealth or in-person appointment. By using provincial pharmacy database, we determined the prescription fill rate. A total of 206 patients were identified who were provided new prescriptions or prescription renewal at their gastroenterology clinic visit. One hundred and three patients were seen through in-person visit during pre-pandemic period, and 103 patients were seen through telehealth appointment during COVID-19 pandemic. The mean age of patients was 49.2 years (55% female). On average, patients had 4.7 previous visits with their gastroenterologists before their visit. IBD management was the most common reason for visits (37.9% and 46.6% in telehealth and in-person groups, respectively). Prescription fill rate for patients seen through telehealth was 92.2% compared to 81.6% for the in-person group (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.12-6.45; <i>P</i> = 0.023). Medication adherence rate for telehealth visits was higher than for in-patient visits. These findings suggest that telehealth can be an effective method of care delivery, especially for patients with chronic gastrointestinal conditions like IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy is a rare multisystem autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the TYMP gene, that encodes for thymidine phosphorylase. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by a distinctive tetrad of gastrointestinal dysmotility, peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia with ptosis, and asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy. It provides a diagnostic dilemma to physicians in regions like Pakistan because of a lack of genetic study availability and associated financial constraints of the population. However, with careful examination and a few basic investigations, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy can be diagnosed by ruling out most of the close differentials. We report the case of a 23-year-old Asian female whose chief complaints were epigastric pain, bilious emesis, weight loss for 3 months, and bilateral lower limb weakness for 20 days. All clinical signs and symptoms along with relevant investigations including nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were highly suggestive of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome. Because of financial constraints, genetic studies could not be performed. The patient was managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving gastroenterology, physiotherapy, and nutrition departments. Currently, therapeutic options for the disease include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and carrier erythrocyte entrapped thymidine phosphorylase; however, these could not be provided to the patient owing to certain limitations. As misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are quite common in this disease, the prime objective of this case report is to increase the basic understanding of this disease, especially its signs and symptoms, and address the limitations regarding the diagnostic investigations and management of patients with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is characterised by discontinuous, relapsing enteric inflammation. Instituting advanced therapies at an early stage to suppress inflammation aims to prevent future complications such as stricturing or penetrating disease, and subsequent surgical resection. Therapeutics are effective but associated with certain side-effects and relatively expensive. There is therefore an urgent need for robust methods to predict which newly diagnosed patients will develop disabling disease, to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early, advanced therapies. We aim to determine if magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) features at diagnosis improve prediction of disabling CD within 5 years of diagnosis. We describe the protocol for a multicentre, non-randomised, single-arm, prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed CD. We will use patients already recruited to the METRIC study and extend their clinical follow-up, as well as a separate group of newly diagnosed patients who were not part of the METRIC trial (MRE within 3 months of diagnosis), to ensure an adequate sample size. Follow-up will extend for at least 4 years. The primary outcome is to evaluate the comparative predictive ability of prognostic models incorporating MRE severity scores (Magnetic resonance Enterography Global Score (MEGS), simplified MAgnetic Resonance Index of Activity (sMaRIA) and Lémann Index) versus models using standard characteristics alone to predict disabling CD (modified Beaugerie definition) within 5 years of new diagnosis. This study protocol achieved National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (NHS REC), London-Hampstead Research Ethics Committee approval (IRAS 217422). Our findings will be disseminated via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. ISRCTN76899103.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to observe the symptoms and bowel habit pattern experienced by patients presenting with self reporting constipation at Out Patient Department in a tertiary care hospital. It was a cross-sectional study which was conducted in Out Patient Department of gastroenterology in North East Medical College Hospital, Sylhet, Bangladesh from January 2017 to December 2018. Total 228 consecutive patients with self reported constipation were enrolled in this study. Patients with history of abdominal surgery, known chronic disease, age below 18 years, pregnant women, patients using drugs like anti-depressant, anti-psychotic and patients unwilling to take part in the study were excluded. Demographic data, symptoms, bowel habit pattern and character of stool were recorded at enrollment in a pre-designed data sheet. Total 228 patients, male 130(57.0%) and female 98(43.0%), age varying from 18-81 years (mean age 38.7±15.10 years) were included. Among them 127 patients (55.7%) was experienced daily bowel motion with frequency varying from one to seven and 99 patients (44.3%) had infrequent stools. Sixteen (16) patients (7.0%), 182 patients (79.8%) and 30 patients (13.2%) had feeling of complete bowel evacuation all time, few days in a week and almost never respectively. Among the patients 127(55.7%), 29(12.7%), 06(2.6%), 02(0.9%) and 64(28.1%) complained of hard, soft, semi liquid, liquid and stool of variable consistency respectively. In this study 159(63.73%), 21(9.21%) and 43(18.85%) patients were regularly taking Proton pump inhibitor (PPI), anti- diabetic drugs and anti-hypertensive drugs respectively. The finding suggests that there was a wide variation of self perception of constipation among the patient. The study concludes that patient's perception regarding constipation does not always match the traditional medical definition. Overall findings signify that symptoms like stool consistency, volume, and feeling of incomplete evacuation are more important rather than frequency of bowel per week in patients' perception regarding constipation. However, further study with large sample size in different hospitals in different areas could explain this observation more precisely.",

        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has long been the cornerstone of treatment for anemia due to GI bleeding. However, blood is not devoid of potential adverse effects, and it is also a precious resource, with limited supplies in blood banks. Nowadays, all patients should benefit from a patient blood management (PBM) program that aims to minimize blood loss, optimize hematopoiesis (mainly by using iron replacement therapy), maximize tolerance of anemia, and avoid unnecessary transfusions. Integration of PBM into healthcare management reduces patient mortality and morbidity and supports a restrictive RBC transfusion approach by reducing transfusion rates. The European Commission has outlined strategies to support hospitals with the implementation of PBM, but it is vital that these initiatives are translated into clinical practice. To help optimize management of anemia and iron deficiency in adults with acute or chronic GI bleeding, we developed a protocol under the auspices of the Spanish Association of Gastroenterology, in collaboration with healthcare professionals from 16 hospitals across Spain, including expert advice from different specialties involved in PBM strategies, such as internal medicine physicians, intensive care specialists, and hematologists. Recommendations include how to identify patients who have anemia (or iron deficiency) requiring oral/intravenous iron replacement therapy and/or RBC transfusion (using a restrictive approach to transfusion), and transfusing RBC units 1 unit at a time, with assessment of patients after each given unit (i.e., \"don't give two without review\"). The advantages and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron and guidance on the safe and effective use of intravenous iron are also described. Implementation of a PBM strategy and clinical decision-making support, including early treatment of anemia with iron supplementation in patients with GI bleeding, may improve patient outcomes and lower hospital costs.",

        "Title": "Bibliometric-analysis visualization and review of non-invasive methods for monitoring and managing the portal hypertension.",
        "Abstract": "Portal hypertension monitoring is important throughout the natural course of cirrhosis. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), regarded as the golden standard, is limited by invasiveness and technical difficulties. Portal hypertension is increasingly being assessed non-invasively, and hematological indices, imaging data, and statistical or computational models are studied to surrogate HVPG. This paper discusses the existing non-invasive methods based on measurement principles and reviews the methodological developments in the last 20 years. First, we used VOSviewer to learn the architecture of this field. The publications about the non-invasive assessment of portal hypertension were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). VOSviewer 1.6.17.0 was used to analyze and visualize these publications, including the annual trend, the study hotspots, the significant articles, authors, journals, and organizations in this field. Next, according to the cluster analysis result of the keywords, we further retrieved and classified the related studies to discuss. A total of 1,088 articles or review articles about our topic were retrieved from WoSCC. From 2000 to 2022, the number of publications is generally growing. \"World Journal of Gastroenterology\" published the most articles (<i>n</i> = 43), while \"Journal of Hepatology\" had the highest citations. \"Liver fibrosis\" published in 2005 was the most influential manuscript. Among the 20,558 cited references of 1,088 retrieved manuscripts, the most cited was a study on liver stiffness measurement from 2007. The highest-yielding country was the United States, followed by China and Italy. \"Berzigotti, Annalisa\" was the most prolific author and had the most cooperation partners. Four study directions emerged from the keyword clustering: (1) the evaluation based on fibrosis; (2) the evaluation based on hemodynamic factors; (3) the evaluation through elastography; and (4) the evaluation of variceal bleeding. The non-invasive assessment of portal hypertension is mainly based on two principles: fibrosis and hemodynamics. Liver fibrosis is the major initiator of cirrhotic PH, while hemodynamic factors reflect secondary alteration of splanchnic blood flow. Blood tests, US (including DUS and CEUS), CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) support the non-invasive assessment of PH by providing both hemodynamic and fibrotic information. Elastography, mainly USE, is the most important method of PH monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "To conduct a regional audit assessing the prevalence and management of malnutrition in decompensated liver disease. All adults admitted with decompensated cirrhosis over one-month period to participating trusts were included. Malnutrition was identified using MUST and Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritisation Tool (RFH-NPT). 47 patients were identified. The prevalence of malnutrition was 76.6%. This was independent of age (<65 versus ≥65; p = 1) or aetiology of liver disease (alcohol-related versus not; p = 0.55). Screening was significantly higher on Gastroenterology wards than other wards (77% versus 23%; p = 0.012). RFH-NPT identified 76.6% of patients as malnourished whereas MUST identified 55.3%. Supplementation was prescribed to 83% of eligible patients. 80% was oral supplementation and 20% received NG feeding. Median length of stay (9 (2-62) days) was higher in those prescribed supplements (11 vs 7 days, p = 0.041). Readmission rates were similar regardless of supplementation. Mortality was higher in malnourished patients (p = 0.03) and in those prescribed nutritional supplements at 1, 3 and 6 months (p = 0.026, p = 0.026 and p = 0.008) respectively, who were more likely to have severe liver disease. Prevalence of malnutrition is high in patients with decompensated cirrhosis but independent of age and aetiology and associated with higher Child-Pugh scores. The RFH-NPT was a more sensitive screening tool than MUST. Increased nutritional screening was noted on gastroenterology wards with more intervention in those with severe liver disease. Despite the study's limitations, once malnourished, nutritional intervention did not appear to impact on patient readmission or mortality rates therefore, we propose addressing malnutrition by utilising specialty dietician involvement at an earlier stage.",

        "Abstract": "Interventional radiology can be used to perform complex pancreatic duct (PD) interventions in cases in which PD abnormalities limit the feasibility of an endoscopic approach. A multidisciplinary approach with gastroenterology using the rendezvous technique can improve procedural success. The establishment of through-and-through access to the PD via a combined percutaneous and endoscopic approach can be used when endoscopy alone fails. In this study, 3 cases are presented in which the rendezvous technique was successfully employed to access the PD for subsequent interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Systemic oxalosis is a condition in which calcium oxalate crystals deposit into various bodily tissues. Although this may occur as the result of a rare primary syndrome in which an error of glyoxylate metabolism causes an overproduction of oxalate, it is more often seen as a secondary process characterized by increased enteric oxalate absorption. Here, we describe a patient with short bowel syndrome on long-term parenteral nutrition support who developed a unique manifestation of systemic oxalosis, leading to deposition of oxalate crystals within the bone marrow contributing to pancytopenia. In this report, in addition to reviewing the literature on this presumably rare manifestation of oxalosis, we also discuss its pathogenesis in the setting of short bowel syndrome and its management, including prevention.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine. At present, the significance of appendiceal orifice inflammation (AOI) in UC prognosis is still controversial. This prospective observational study investigated the importance of AOI in UC diagnosis and prognosis. Additionally, it compared the therapeutic efficacy of treatments in UC patients with or without AOI. This study was a prospective, observational, single-centre, real-world study. Patients with AOI were included in the observation group, and patients without AOI were assigned to the control group. All patients were followed up for 1 year; the disease remission and treatment efficacy were re-examined by colonoscopy. In addition, the clinical, endoscopic and pathological features were collected before and after the treatment. Patients with endoscopic diffuse inflammatory changes in the distal colorectum accompanied by AOI had a higher positive UC diagnosis rate than those without (96.5% vs 78.0%). Also, AOI had a specificity of 95.2% and a sensitivity of 28.3% for UC diagnosis. However, no difference in the modified Mayo score (p=0.881) or Baron grading was observed between the control and observation groups, indicating that AOI does not affect the treatment outcome of UC patients. In this study, the observation of AOI improved the UC diagnostic accuracy in patients with diffuse lesions in the distal colorectum. Furthermore, the presence of AOI does not affect the treatment efficacies of UC. ChiCTR1800017753.",

The objective examination showed an erythematous-whitish plaque with well-defined, slightly exudative and verrucous limits in the perianal region. Definitive diagnosis was possible by biopsy of the referred lesion carried out by Dermatology, and the histological findings were compatible with Paget's disease: intraepithelial infiltration by large atypical neoplastic cells and hypochromic halo and positive immunostaining for cytokeratin 7.

The differential diagnosis includes hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema, without urticaria or pruritus, which most often affects the skin, but also mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, triggered by diverse factors such as infections, trauma, surgery, drugs, or stress. It is a disease with a difficult diagnosis due to its heterogeneous and transitory clinical features, so having a clinical suspicion in the appropriate context would allow the administration of a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary examinations. We present the case of a 19-year-old male followed-up for recurrent abdominal pain that, after numerous microbiological, endoscopic, and radiological examinations, complement tests were requested, obtaining low levels of C4 with increased levels of C1 inhibitor and reduced functional activity, being diagnosed with HAE type II.",

        "Abstract": "There is a paucity of research on the use of the electronic health record (EHR) by gastroenterology and hepatology providers and its effect on work-life balance. Our aim was to study the after-hour EHR work completed among providers within a multispecialty academic practice. Time spent completing EHR tasks during evening hours (7p-7a) and days off was prospectively recorded for 35 providers over six consecutive months at a single center. Type and time of EHR tasks completed were compared based on subspecialty, academic degree, academic track category, identified gender, and number of weekly assigned clinical days worked. Prior to the data collection, providers filled out a survey regarding EHR use, work hours, and work-life balance. All providers used EHR during evening hours and during days off. The total mean after-hours time spent completing EHR tasks was 18.4 m (± 13.0) per day and 45.0 m (± 25.8) during days off. There was significant variation in the daily mean after-hours time spent completing EHR tasks among subspecialties, range 45.3 m (± 27.1) (advanced endoscopy)-28.7 m (± 22.7) (hepatology), and among providers who work clinically > 7.5 days per week versus those who do not, 42.1 m (± 25.7) vs 30.0 m (± 14.0). The most common after-hours EHR task was note completion. 83% providers reported being unable to complete EHR tasks during allotted workday time and 87% report that EHR tasks interfered with family life; 74% with social life. Gastroenterology and hepatology providers spend a significant amount of after-hour time completing EHR tasks which is perceived to interfere with family/social life.",

With an increase in hospitalization rates of acute pancreatitis among the pediatric population, the importance of understanding rare complications and how to further recognize these complications can aid in the diagnosis, medical management, and intervention necessary to optimize a patient's outcome. Our patient presented with a rare complication of splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), which is a complication that can also be observed in adults with acute pancreatitis. SVTs are uncommon in both the adult and pediatric populations, and they have received little attention or research in the pediatric population.

        "Abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a local and/or systemic inflammatory disease that starts with acinar cell injury and necrosis; it has no effective medical treatment and thus remains a life-threatening condition. Interleukin-37 (IL-37), a natural immunomodulator, has demonstrated an antiinflammatory effect; however, the role of IL-37 in AP remains unknown. The serum IL-37 levels of 39 healthy controls and 94 patients with AP were measured. Cholecystokinin was applied to induce pancreatic acinar cell injury in vitro. Classical experimental AP models, such as caerulein, l-arginine, and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate disodium salt, were included in the in vivo study. A transgenic mouse model with the IL-37 gene and administration of recombinant IL-37 were used to further investigate the function of IL-37 in AP. Pancreas-specific gasdermin D-knockout (GSDMD-knockout) mice were used to explore the protective mechanism of IL-37. Our results showed that serum IL-37 levels in humans were negatively correlated with the severity of AP. Furthermore, IL-37-transgenic mice and supplementation with recombinant IL-37 could both protect against AP. Mechanistically, IL-37 was able to suppress pyroptosis of injured acinar cells, and specific depletion of GSDMD in the pancreas counteracted the protective effect of IL-37. Our study demonstrates that IL-37 protects against acinar cell pyroptosis in AP.",

        "Abstract": "The drugs impacted by genetic variants are known as pharmacogenetic (PGx) drugs. Patients' responses to these drugs may vary according to the variability in patients' genetic makeup. Hence, exploring the pharmacogenes that affect drug treatment is vital to ensure optimal therapy and patients' safety. This study aimed to describe the usage rate of PGx drugs and the frequency of relevant variants in the Saudi population. Prescription patterns over seven years (2015-2021) for Saudi patients on PGx drugs treated at the Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs (MNG-HA) were investigated. Only registered drugs in the MNG-HA formulary (n = 78) were included. The patients were subgrouped into four age groups: ≤24, 25-44, 45-64, and ≥65 years. Further subgrouping was made according to gender and drugs' therapeutic categories following anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification.Furthermore, an online searching was carried out to identify the pharmacogenes reported in the literature among healthy Saudis. The search included 45 genes that may affect drug outcomes based on evidence rated by either CPIC (A-B levels) or PharmGKB (1-2 levels). The screened patients were 1,483,905. Patients on PGx drugs accounted for 46.7% (n = 693,077 patients). The analgesic group was the most prescribed drug category (47%), which included ibuprofen (20.5%), celecoxib (6.3%), tramadol (5.8%), and others. Cardiovascular agents were the second-most utilized drug class (24.4%). Omeprazole was the second most commonly used medication (11.1%) but ranked third as a class (gastroenterology). Females used PGx drugs more frequently than males (53.5% versus 46.5%) and a higher usage rate by patients aged 45-64 years (31.3%) was noted. The cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6) were estimated to impact responses of 54.3% (n = 1,156,113) of the used drugs (27.2% are possibly affected by CYP2C9, 12.8% by CYP2C19, and 14.3% by CYP2D6). Thirty-five pharmacogenes that characterize Saudi population and their variants' allele frequencies were identified from previous reports. This study presents the largest reported number of genes that may affect drug therapies among Saudis. This study confirmed that a high percentage of Saudi patients use PGx drugs and various genotypes of certain pharmacogenes are inherited by the Saudi population.",

        "Title": "Disease specific symptoms indices in patients with celiac disease-A hardly recognised entity.",
        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) was considered a rare disease before and was perceivably only limited to children but now affects almost 1-2% of the global population. This abrupt increase in prevalence is due to advancements in diagnostic criteria and medical facilities but still many countries lack the basic data that can assess the severity of this health issue. The present study was conducted with the aim to assess the common but rarely diagnosed condition with the identification of its underlying secondary ailments. Patients visiting public sector hospitals were recruited and tested for clinical symptoms secondary to gluten-containing foods (wheat and barley, etc.), followed by serological testing for immunoglobulin A, tissue transglutaminase A, and anti-endomysial antibodies. Only seropositive candidates were included in the endoscopic and biopsy examination for the features of villous atrophy and intestinal cell damage. The secondary ailments including anemia, growth retardation, and gastrointestinal symptoms were also documented for the tested positive patients. The modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criterion was followed throughout the study. From 647 suspected cases from March 2018 to July 2019, 113 were confirmed with CD while 58% were female children and 42% were male children. The majority of them were from a lower class (75%) and 26% of them had a positive family history of CD. A total of 67% of patients with CD were underweight while wasting was observed in 38%, and 80% were stunted as well. Of the positively tested patients with CD, 49% had moderate anemia with 15% having severe anemia. Approximately 33% had hypoalbuminemia as well. The majority of them had a mild to severe range of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatus, eructation, diarrhea, and steatorrhea. The study finding indicates an increased number of patients diagnosed with CD with an excessive sum of secondary ailments, such as anemia, growth failure, growth retardation, malnutrition, and gastrointestinal symptoms.",

        "Title": "Update on gut microbiota in gastrointestinal diseases.",
        "Abstract": "The human gut is a complex microbial ecosystem comprising approximately 100 trillion microbes collectively known as the \"gut microbiota\". At a rough estimate, the human gut microbiome contains almost 3.3 million genes, which are about 150 times more than the total human genes present in the human genome. The vast amount of genetic information produces various enzymes and physiologically active substances. Thus, the gut microbiota contributes to the maintenance of host health; however, when healthy microbial composition is perturbed, a condition termed \"dysbiosis\", the altered gut microbiota can trigger the development of various gastrointestinal diseases. The gut microbiota has consequently become an extremely important research area in gastroenterology. It is also expected that the results of research into the gut microbiota will be applied to the prevention and treatment of human gastrointestinal diseases. A randomized controlled trial conducted by a Dutch research group in 2013 showed the positive effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI). These findings have led to the development of treatments targeting the gut microbiota, such as probiotics and FMT for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other diseases. This review focuses on the association of the gut microbiota with human gastrointestinal diseases, including CDI, IBD, and irritable bowel syndrome. We also summarize the therapeutic options for targeting the altered gut microbiota, such as probiotics and FMT.",

        "Abstract": "Viral hepatitis is an endemic disease in Chad. However, few studies have documented coinfection cases and their impact on cardiovascular risk. This study is aimed at analyzing hepatitis B, E and dengue coinfection in a Chadian cohort and gauge its effect on lipidemia. <i>Patients and Methods</i>. From February to May 2021, 179 subjects were recruited from the Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine of the National Reference University Hospital of N'Djamena and tested for viral hepatitis markers, including HBsAg and IgM/IgG anti-HEV and dengue infection, using the NS1/IgM/IgG kit. Serum transaminases and biomarkers of lipid profiles were assayed by colorimetry, and atherogenic indexes (AI) and coronary risk (CRI) were calculated. Of the 179 subjects surveyed, 21.22% (38/179) tested positive for hepatitis B, 20% (27/135) for hepatitis E, and 1.66% (2/120) for dengue. However, most of the patients were found to be asymptomatic. Hepatitis B/E coinfection was more frequent in the study population (5.02%; 9/179) than dengue/hepatitis E coinfection (0.83%; 1/120; IgM). The prevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies was higher (18.52%) than that of IgM (1.48%). Furthermore, IgG antibodies levels in HEV-monoinfected subjects (11.05 ± 1.93 IU/mL, <i>N</i> = 15) were significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) than in coinfected patients (5.40 ± 1.31 IU/mL, <i>N</i> = 9). Subjects coinfected with HEV/HBV were associated with a significantly higher risk of lipodystrophy (coronary risk: 88.89% vs. 35.3%, relative risk (RR) = 2.55; <i>p</i> = 0.014), than HEV-monoinfected subjects, as evidenced by higher mean levels of triglycerides levels (219.88 ± 14.67 mg/dL vs. 191.82 ± 4.66  mg/dL, <i>p</i> < 0.05), more reduced HDL-C levels (9.05 ± 1.62 mg/dL vs. 18.93 ± 2.35 mg/dL, <i>p</i> < 0.05), increased mean CRI (13.81 ± 2.39 vs. 6.89 ± 1.93, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and AI (1.46 ± 0.10 vs. 1.05 ± 0.05, <i>p</i> < 0.01) values. However, they had normal transaminase values and a lower risk of developing a liver injury, although not significant (alanine aminotransferase: 0% vs. 29.4%, RR = 1, <i>p</i> = 0.128; aspartate aminotransferase: 0% vs. 5.88%, <i>p</i> = 1) than this group. HBV/HEV coinfection is frequent in the Chadian cohort and associated with an important risk of dyslipidemia. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism of action.",

        "Abstract": "Gastric cancer pathological biopsy and visual examination have been the gold standard for gastric cancer diagnosis, but their operation is costly, demanding, and risky, so it is especially important to find an effective examination method in clinical practice. To investigate the correlation between serum pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), pepsinogen I and II ratio (PGR), IL-6, and TNF-<i>α</i> and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in patients with gastric cancer. Fifty patients with Hp-infected gastric cancer admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of our hospital from January 2019 to December 2021 were selected for the study as the observation group, and another 50 patients without Hp-infected gastric cancer were selected as the comparison group to compare the correlation analysis of PGI, PGII, PGR, IL-6, and TNF-<i>α</i> with Hp infection between the two groups after admission and treatment. After measurement, PGI and PGII in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the comparison group, and TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-18, and IL-6 in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the comparison group, and the comparative differences were all statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The results of multivariate logistic regression model analysis of independent risk factors for gastric cancer showed that IL-18, hs-CRP, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) <i>α</i> were risk factors for Hp infection in gastric cancer. The expression of IL-18, hs-CRP, and TNF-<i>α</i> factors in Hp-infected gastric cancer patients is correlated. IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-<i>α</i> are involved in the entire process from the onset to the development of Hp-positive gastric mucosal inflammation in patients, which is of great value in the diagnosis of gastric cancer and helps to assess the degree of progression and prognosis of gastric cancer.",

        "Title": "Involvement of toll-like receptor 5 in mouse model of colonic hypersensitivity induced by neonatal maternal separation.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic abdominal pain is the most common cause for gastroenterology consultation and is frequently associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. These disorders present similar brain/gut/microbiota trialogue alterations, associated with abnormal intestinal permeability, intestinal dysbiosis and colonic hypersensitivity (CHS). Intestinal dysbiosis can alter colon homeostasis leading to abnormal activation of the innate immunity that promotes CHS, perhaps involving the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which play a central role in innate immunity. To understand the mechanisms between early life event paradigm on intestinal permeability, fecal microbiota composition and CHS development in mice with TLRs expression in colonocytes. Maternal separation model (NMS) CHS model, which mimics deleterious events in childhood that can induce a wide range of chronic disorders during adulthood were used. Colonic sensitivity of NMS mice was evaluated by colorectal distension (CRD) coupled with intracolonic pressure variation (IPV) measurement. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing from weaning to CRD periods. TLR mRNA expression was evaluated in colonocytes. Additionally, the effect of acute intrarectal instillation of the TLR5 agonist flagellin (FliC) on CHS in adult naive wildtype mice was analyzed. Around 50% of NMS mice exhibited increased intestinal permeability and CHS associated with intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by a significant decrease of species richness, an alteration of the core fecal microbiota and a specific increased relative abundance of flagellated bacteria. Only TLR5 mRNA expression was increased in colonocytes of NMS mice with CHS. Acute intrarectal instillation of FliC induced transient increase of IPV, reflecting transient CHS appearance. Altogether, these data suggest a pathophysiological continuum between intestinal dysbiosis and CHS, with a role for TLR5.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. Tumor markers like carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) have been proven valuable as a diagnostic tool and a predictor for tumor staging and response to therapy. To delineate the phenotype of normal CA 19-9 PDAC according to clinical features, disease staging and prognosis as compared with high CA 19-9 PDAC cases. We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of all PDAC cases admitted in our Gastroenterology department over a period of 30 mo that were diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition. Patients were divided into two groups according to CA 19-9 levels over a threshold of 37 U/mL. We performed a comparison between the two groups with regard to demographic and clinical data, biomarkers, tumor staging and 6-mo survival. Altogether 111 patients were recruited with 29 having documented normal CA 19-9 (< 37 U/mL). In the CA 19-9 negative group of patients, 20.68% had elevated levels of both CEA and CA 125, 13.79% for CA 125 only whilst 17.24% for CEA only. The two groups had similar demographic characteristics. Abdominal pain was more frequently reported in positive <i>vs</i> negative CA 19-9 PDAC cases (76.83% <i>vs</i> 55.17%), while smoking was slightly more prevalent in the latter group (28.04% <i>vs</i> 31.03%). Tumors over 2 cm were more frequently seen in the positive CA 19-9 group, reflecting a higher proportion of locally advanced and metastatic neoplasia (87.7% <i>vs</i> 79.3%). Six-month survival was higher for the negative CA 19-9 group (58.62% <i>vs</i> 47.56%). Elevated CA 19-9 at diagnosis seems to be associated with a more pronounced symptomatology, high tumor burden and poor prognosis compared to negative CA 19-9 PDAC cases. CEA and CA 125 can be adjunctive useful markers for PDAC, especially in CA 19-9 negative cases.",

        "Abstract": "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a clinical syndrome that occurs in patients with cirrhosis and is characterised by acute deterioration, organ failure and high short-term mortality. Alcohol is one of the leading causes of ACLF and the most frequently reported aetiology of underlying chronic liver disease. Among patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH), ACLF is a frequent and severe complication. It is characterised by both immune dysfunction associated to an increased risk of infection and high-grade systemic inflammation that ultimately induce organ failure. Diagnosis and severity of ACLF determine AH prognosis, and therefore, ACLF prognostic scores should be used in severe AH with organ failure. Corticosteroids remain the first-line treatment for severe AH but they seem insufficient when ACLF is associated. Novel therapeutic targets to contain the excessive inflammatory response and reduce infection have been identified and are under investigation. With liver transplantation remaining one of the most effective therapies for severe AH and ACLF, adequate organ allocation represents a growing challenge. Hence, a clear understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical implications and management strategies of ACLF in AH is essential for hepatologists, which is narrated briefly in this review.",

While patients' life expectancy and quality of life have improved dramatically due to medical advances, children continue to experience health-related issues that often require hospitalizations. The association among sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with potentially preventable hospitalizations (PPH) in children and youth with myelomeningocele type SB was investigated in this cross-sectional study. Chart reviews and data extraction were conducted on 108 children and youth, ages 1 month to 21 years, admitted for PPH in a regional children's academic medical center between May 2017 and July 2019. Sociodemographic variables included sex, age, type of insurance and ethnicity. Clinical variables included level of lesion, ambulation status, shunt dependency and selected diagnostic categories. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with PPH. Factors associated with PPH included being male, ages 5-18 years, low lumbar level lesions, non-ambulatory, with public insurance, Hispanic and shunt dependent. Most hospitalizations (73%) were for neurologic or urologic conditions. Factors independently associated with PPH were ethnicity for urologic conditions, being ambulatory for metabolic conditions, and age for gastroenterology conditions. Selected demographic and clinical variables were found to be associated with PPH of children and youth with myelomeningocele-type SB. The most common reasons for PPH were shunt malfunctions and urinary tract infections, consistent with other studies.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of glucocorticoid-responsive autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC), a new disease entity, has attracted considerable interest within the international gastroenterology community. The typical manifestations of AIP/IgG4-SC are obstructive jaundice and pancreatic enlargement in the elderly, which may mimic the presentations of pancreatobiliary malignancies. The timely diagnosis of AIP/IgG4-SC can lead to adequate glucocorticoid treatment, whereas a misdiagnosis can result in unnecessary major surgery. The diagnostic criteria used to diagnose AIP include several cardinal features of AIP that can be detected via pancreatic parenchymal imaging, ductal imaging, serum IgG4 levels, histopathology, other organ involvement, and response to glucocorticoid therapy. The differential diagnosis of AIP/IgG4-SC may include pancreatobiliary malignancies and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Although most patients with AIP/IgG4-SC respond well to glucocorticoid therapy, there is a frequent relapse of the disease in the long term. This review describes the evolution of the concept of AIP and IgG4-related disease, including the development of diagnostic criteria, discusses the current practice for diagnosis and treatment, and suggests prospects for research.",

All participants underwent traditional verbal consent and a subset viewed the language and procedure specific video. Participants from a multilingual, safety-net hospital patient population were then given a questionnaire to assess their comprehension and satisfaction. Participants who watched the video had higher comprehension scores than those who received traditional verbal consent alone. This difference persisted when data was stratified by language and procedure, and when controlled for educational level and prior procedure. Video consent improves comprehension and satisfaction for endoscopy and may mitigate some of the challenges encountered when consenting patients with LEP.",

The many comorbidities lead to high disease burden, which requires greater healthcare utilization. This survey of families examines healthcare utilization, of adults and minors, through evaluation of subspecialty care appointments across many healthcare systems in one region. There were 155 adults and 83 minors with a diagnosis of EDS with a total of 693 unique visits across 27 different specialties at over 20 different hospitals or clinics in the surveyed area. Cardiology, neurology, and gastroenterology were the most utilized subspecialties for adults, while rheumatology, cardiology, and neurology were most utilized by minors. Many respondents (67%) reported their medical care needs are not being met, and 87% reported interest in a multidisciplinary clinic for EDS with the most interest in pain management, physical and occupational therapy, and rheumatology. Understanding healthcare utilization and needs of those with EDS can provide the foundation for improved care for those with EDS through a coordinated multidisciplinary care model.",

        "Abstract": "Barrett's oesophagus with indefinite for dysplasia (IDD) carries a risk of prevalent and incident dysplasia and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This study seeks to determine the risk of neoplasia in a multicentre prospective IDD cohort, along with determining adherence to British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for management and histology reporting. This was a cohort study using prospectively collected data from pathology databases from two centres in the North West of England (UK). Cases with IDD were identified over a 10-year period. Data were obtained on patient demographics, Barrett's endoscopy findings and histology, outcomes and histological reporting. 102 biopsies with IDD diagnosis in 88 patients were identified. Endoscopy was repeated in 78/88 (88%) patients. 12/78 progressed to low-grade dysplasia (15% or 2.6 per 100 person years), 6/78 (7.7%, 1.3 per 100 person years) progressed to high-grade dysplasia and 6/78 (7.7%, 1.3 per 100 person years) progressed to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The overall incidence rate for progression to any type of dysplasia was 5.1 per 100 person years. Cox regression analysis identified longer Barrett's segment, multifocal and persistent IDD as predictors of progression to dysplasia. Histology reporting did not meet 100% adherence to the BSG histology reporting minimum dataset prior to or after the introduction of the guidelines. IDD carries significant risk of progression to dysplasia or neoplasia. Therefore, careful diagnosis and management aided by clear histological reporting of these cases is required to diagnose prevalent and incident neoplasia.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are known to benefit from care delivered in a specialized, interdisciplinary setting. We aimed to evaluate the impact of this model on health outcomes, quality metrics, and health care resource utilization (HRU) in IBD patients insured with Medicaid. In July 2017, IBD patients at our tertiary hospital were transitioned from a fellows' general gastroenterology (GI) clinic to a fellows' interdisciplinary IBD clinic. IBD patients were included if they were insured with Medicaid, had at least 1 visit in the general GI clinic between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017, and at least 1 visit between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 in the IBD clinic. Characteristics related to patients' IBD course, overall health care maintenance, and HRU were compared. A total of 170 patients (51% male, mean age 39 y) were included. After the transition to the IBD clinic, use of corticosteroids (37% vs. 25%; P =0.004) and combination therapy were significantly lower (55% vs. 38%; P =0.0004), although use of high-dose biologics numerically increased (58.5% vs. 67%; P =0.05). Posttransition, patients showed significantly lower levels of mean C-reactive protein ( P =0.04). After the transition, patients attended significantly fewer outpatient GI visits ( P =0.0008) but were more often seen by other health care specialists ( P =0.0003), and experienced a numeric decrease in HRU with fewer emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries. Care in an interdisciplinary, IBD specialty setting is associated with significantly decreased corticosteroid use, decreased C-reactive protein levels, and improved access to ancillary services in Medicaid patients.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the perceptions and practices of Australasian paediatric gastroenterologists in diagnosing coeliac disease (CD) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Paediatric gastroenterologists in Australasia were invited via email to complete an anonymous online questionnaire over a 2-week period in 2021. The questionnaire was completed by 39 respondents: 33 from Australia and six from New Zealand (NZ) equating to a 66% response rate. Thirty-four (87%) of the 39 respondents reported they currently practised non-biopsy diagnosis of CD in eligible children, while the rest diagnosed CD using biopsy confirmation only. All NZ respondents practised non-biopsy CD diagnosis. A majority of responders (76%) who practised non-biopsy CD diagnosis followed the 2020 European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines. Twenty-two (56%) respondents reported that they started using a non-biopsy CD diagnosis protocol before the pandemic and did not change their practice during the pandemic, 10 (26%) started diagnosing non-biopsy CD during the pandemic, 5 (13%) stated their practices of CD were not impacted by the pandemic and 2 (5%) did not respond on whether the pandemic changed their practice. The majority of Australasian gastroenterologist respondents reported they routinely utilised the 2020 ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria in eligible children; half of them started prior to the pandemic and another quarter started this approach due to the pandemic. A minority of practitioners routinely rely only on biopsy confirmation to diagnose CD.",

        "Abstract": "At the beginning of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, physicians paid close attention to children with chronic diseases to prevent transmission or a severe course of infection. We aimed to measure the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody levels in children with chronic gastrointestinal and liver diseases to analyze the risk factors for infection and its interaction with their primary disease. This cross-sectional study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in patients with gastrointestinal and liver diseases (n=141) and in healthy children (n=48) between January and February 2021. During the pandemic, 10 patients (7%) and 1 child (2%) had confirmed COVID-19 infection (<i>p</i>=0.2). The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive in 36 patients (25.5%) and 11 children (22.9%) (<i>p</i>=0.7). SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity was found in 20.4%, 26.6%, 33.3%, and 33.3% of patients with chronic liver diseases, chronic gastrointestinal tract diseases, cystic fibrosis, and liver transplantation recipients, respectively (<i>p</i>>0.05, patients vs. healthy children). Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity were COVID-19-related symptoms (47.2% vs. 14.2%, <i>p</i>=0.00004) and close contact with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive patients (69.4% vs. 9%, <i>p</i><0.00001). The use, number, and type of immunosuppressants and primary diagnosis were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. The frequency of disease activation/flare was not significant in patients with (8.3%) or without (14.2%) antibody positivity (<i>p</i>=0.35). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children with chronic gastrointestinal and liver diseases are similar to that in healthy children. Close follow-up is important to understand the long-term effects of past COVID-19 infection in these children.",

This study aimed to compare the clinical, hematological, biochemical, and histological features of infants with BA based on their CMV immunoglobulin M (IgM) status at presentation. This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out between January 2019 and June 2020 at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) in Dhaka. Forty-three patients with BA were selected purposively and categorized into either the CMV IgM-positive or CMV IgM-negative BA group. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test and chi-square tests, while the Student's <i>t</i>-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare continuous variables. For all statistical tests, a <i>p</i>-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Thirty-three (76.7%) of the cases were between 2 and 3 months of age on admission. The clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters did not differ significantly between the CMV IgM-positive and CMV IgM-negative BA groups. Most (50.0%) of the CMV IgM-positive cases had fibrosis stage F2, while 43.5% of the CMV IgM-negative cases had fibrosis stage F3, with no significant difference between the groups (<i>p</i>=0.391). Our data shows no significant distinction between CMV IgM-positive and CMV IgM-negative BA, suggesting that CMV does not contribute to BA pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "<i>Background and Objective</i>: <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is a human-stomach-dwelling organism that causes many gastric illnesses, including gastritis, ulcer, and gastric cancer. The purpose of the study was to perform differential proteomic analysis on <i>H. pylori</i> isolates from gastritis, ulcer, and gastric cancer patients. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: <i>H. pylori</i> was isolated from antrum and fundus biopsies obtained from patients who visited the Department of Gastroenterology. Using nano-LC-QTOF MS/MS analysis, differentially regulated proteins were identified through proteome profiling of pooled samples of <i>H. pylori</i> isolated from gastritis, ulcer, and gastric cancer patients. Antigenic scores and cellular localization of proteins were determined using additional prediction tools. <i>Results</i>: A total of 14 significantly regulated proteins were identified in <i>H. pylori</i> isolated from patients with either gastritis, ulcer, or gastric cancer. Comparative analysis of groups revealed that in the case of cancer vs. gastritis, six proteins were overexpressed, out of which two proteins, including hydrogenase maturation factor (hypA) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (ndk) involved in bacterial colonization, were only upregulated in isolates from cancer patients. Similarly, in cancer vs. ulcer, a total of nine proteins were expressed. Sec-independent protein translocase protein (tatB), involved in protein translocation, and pseudaminic acid synthase I (pseI), involved in the synthesis of functional flagella, were upregulated in cancer, while hypA and ndk were downregulated. In ulcer vs. gastritis, eight proteins were expressed. In this group, tatB was overexpressed. A reduction in thioredoxin peroxidase (bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (bcp)) was observed in ulcer vs. gastritis and cancer vs. ulcer. <i>Conclusion</i>: Our study suggested three discrete protein signatures, hypA, tatB, and bcp, with differential expression in gastritis, ulcer, and cancer. Protein expression profiles of <i>H. pylori</i> isolated from patients with these gastric diseases will help to understand the virulence and pathogenesis of <i>H. pylori</i>.",

        "Abstract": "Fluid thickening is the main compensatory strategy for patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) associated with aging or neurological diseases, and there is still no pharmacological treatment. We aimed to compare the effects of increasing bolus viscosity with that of acute stimulation with TRPV1, TRPA1 or TRPM8 agonists on the biomechanics and neurophysiology of swallow response in patients with OD. We retrospectively analyzed seven studies from our laboratory on 329 patients with OD. The effect of increasing shear viscosity up to 3682 mPa·s was compared by videofluoroscopy and pharyngeal sensory evoked potentials (pSEP) with that of adding to the bolus: capsaicin (TRPV1, 150 μM/10 μM), piperine (TRPA1/V1, 1 mM/150 μM), menthol (TRPM8, 1 mM/10 mM), cinnamaldehyde-zinc (TRPA1, 100 ppm−70 mM), citral (TRPA1, 250 ppm) or citral-isopulegol (TRPA1-TRPM8, 250 ppm−200 ppm). Fluid thickening improved the safety of swallow by 80% (p < 0.0001) by delaying bolus velocity by 20.7 ± 7.0% and time to laryngeal vestibule closure (LVC) by 23.1 ± 3.7%. Capsaicin 150μM or piperine 1 mM significantly improved safety of swallow by 50% (p < 0.01) and 57.1% (p < 0.01) by speeding time to LVC by 27.6% (p < 0.001) and 19.5% (p < 0.01) and bolus velocity by 24.8% (p < 0.01) and 16.9% (p < 0.05), respectively. Cinnamaldehyde-zinc shortened the P2 latency of pSEPs by 11.0% (p < 0.01) and reduced N2-P2 amplitude by 35% (p < 0.01). In conclusion, TRPV1 and TRPV1/A1 agonists are optimal candidates to develop new pharmacological strategies to promote the recovery of brain and swallow function in patients with chronic OD.",

        "Abstract": "In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), the Infectious Diseases Society of America in conjunction with the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/SHEA), and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published updated clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections. The differences, sometimes subtle, between these guideline recommendations have caused some debate among clinicians. This paper delves into select key recommendations from each respective CPG and analyzes the differences and evidence associated with each. One primary difference between the CPGs is the preference given to fidaxomicin over vancomycin for initial treatment in non-severe and severe disease endorsed by IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID guidelines, while the ACG-sponsored CPGs do not offer a preference. The emphasis on cost effective data was also a noticeable difference between the CPGs and thus interpretation of the available evidence. When using guidelines to help support local practice or institutional treatment pathways, clinicians should carefully balance CPG recommendations with local patient populations and feasibility of implementation, especially when multiple guidelines for the same disease state exist.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this expert review is to summarize the diagnosis and management of refractory celiac disease. It will review evaluation of patients with celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms, differential diagnosis, nutritional support, potential therapeutic options, and surveillance for complications of this condition. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: In patients believed to have celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by review of prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In patients with confirmed celiac disease with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs (nonresponsive celiac disease), ongoing gluten ingestion should be excluded as a cause of these symptoms with serologic testing, dietitian review, and detection of immunogenic peptides in stool or urine. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies should be performed to look for villous atrophy. If villous atrophy persists or the initial diagnosis of celiac disease was not confirmed, consider other causes of villous atrophy, including common variable immunodeficiency, autoimmune enteropathy, tropical sprue, and medication-induced enteropathy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: For patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, after exclusion of gluten ingestion, perform a systematic evaluation for other potential causes of symptoms, including functional bowel disorders, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose or fructose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Use flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and T-cell receptor rearrangement studies to distinguish between subtypes of refractory celiac disease and to exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Type 1 refractory celiac disease is characterized by a normal intraepithelial lymphocyte population and type 2 is defined by the presence of an aberrant, clonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population. Consultation with an expert hematopathologist is necessary to interpret these studies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Perform small bowel imaging with capsule endoscopy and computed tomography or magnetic resonance enterography to exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunoileitis at initial diagnosis of type 2 refractory celiac disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Complete a detailed nutritional assessment with investigation of micronutrient and macronutrient deficiencies in patients diagnosed with refractory celiac disease. Check albumin as an independent prognostic factor. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Correct deficiencies in macro- and micronutrients using oral supplements and/or enteral support. Consider parenteral nutrition for patients with severe malnutrition due to malabsorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Corticosteroids, most commonly open-capsule budesonide or, if unavailable, prednisone, are the medication of choice and should be used as first-line therapy in either type 1 or type 2 refractory celiac disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Patients with refractory celiac disease require regular follow-up by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterologists and dietitians, to assess clinical and histologic response to therapy. Identify local experts with expertise in celiac disease to assist with management. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with refractory celiac disease without response to steroids may benefit from referral to a center with expertise for management or evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "Functional dyspepsia is the actual problem of modern gastroenterology, its manifestations contribute to the lifting of lifestyle and nutrition. However, a comprehensive assessment of the effect of violations of food behavior, the distribution of adipose tissue and the level of gosters regulating appetite on the severity of gastroenterological symptoms in individuals with various types of functional dyspepsia hasn't been carried out yet. <b>Aim</b> - to clarify the effect of food behavior, ghrelin and leptin blood concentrations on clinical symptoms in patients with different types of functional dyspepsia. <b>Material and methods</b>. A prospective study with the participation of 90 people aged 22.3±0.2, divided into 3 groups was carried out: patients with postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), and practically healthy. All respondents were interviewed using the GSRS, DEBQ questionnaires, their anthropometric data have been defined, body composition indicators were calculated based on the measurement of body circumference measurements, leptin and ghrelin concentration in blood serum was measured by the enzyme immunoassay method. <b>Results</b> and discussion. EPS was characterized by more pronounced symptoms (10.10±0.32 points on the GSRS questionnaire) due to abdominal pain syndrome (4.33±0.51 points) compared with patients with PDS and healthy individuals. In both variants of the functional dyspepsia, all three types of food behavior disorders were revealed, however, the external type was more characteristic for PDS. Patients with PDS had a larger volume of visceral adipose tissue (42.84% of the total fat tissue in the body) than those with EPS (34.02%) and healthy ones (35.55%). Blood leptin concentration in patients with both variants of the functional dyspepsia was lower (especially in patients with EPS - 0.17±0.03 ng/ml, p=0.039) than in healthy (0.32±0.08 ng/ml). Ghrelin level in patients with EPS (14.91±0.17 ng/ml) was significantly higher than in healthy (11.55±0.44 ng/ml, p=0.022). Factor analysis made it possible to identify the stress factor showing the connection of emotional disorders of food behavior with increasing gastrointestinal symptoms and blood leptin concentration and decreasing blood ghrelin level. <b>Conclusion</b>. Different variants of functional dyspepsia are characterized by their own peculiarities of eating behavior, the distribution of fat in the body, the degree of changes in leptin and ghrelin levels, which determine their clinical symptoms. The identification and accounting of these factors will make it possible to individualize the approach to the curation of patients with functional dyspepsia.",

        "Abstract": "Gastric cancer is one of the gastrointestinal malignancies that can be quite devastating with high morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, it is a malignancy that is encountered all across the world and is often brought into suspicion based on symptoms of the patient. The presentation differs based on the symptomatology and can be quite variable in each and every case. Malignant lesions in the stomach discovered endoscopically can represent as primary gastric growths or can be secondary as a consequence of metastatic spread from a distant primary site. It is important to recognize the different patterns of presentation of metastatic disease and to be aware of the primary tumor sites. The treatment and ultimately the prognosis changes drastically when dealing with a metastatic disease as opposed to a primary localized source with limited spread. The aim of our study is to present a mini series of cases that manifest as metastatic gastric growths. Their clinical, endoscopic and histological appearance is depicted to provide an understanding of each case. The primary sites of origin for our patients were the lungs, skin, lymphoid tissue and kidneys. Their overall clinical course is presented including the approach to the management in each case as well as their outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Although Barrett's metaplasia of the esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor lesion to esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs), drivers of cellular transformation in BE remain incompletely understood. We use an artificial intelligence-guided network approach to study EAC initiation and progression. Key predictions are subsequently validated in a human organoid model, in patient-derived biopsy specimens of BE, a case-control study of genomics of BE progression, and in a cross-sectional study of 113 patients with BE and EACs. Our model classified healthy esophagus from BE and BE from EACs in several publicly available gene expression data sets (n = 932 samples). The model confirmed that all EACs must originate from BE and pinpointed a CXCL8/IL8↔neutrophil immune microenvironment as a driver of cellular transformation in EACs and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. This driver is prominent in White individuals but is notably absent in African Americans (AAs). Network-derived gene signatures, independent signatures of neutrophil processes, CXCL8/IL8 expression, and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) are associated with risk of progression. SNPs associated with changes in ANC by ethnicity (e.g., benign ethnic neutropenia [BEN]) modify that risk. Findings define a racially influenced immunological basis for cell transformation and suggest that BEN in AAs may be a deterrent to BE→EAC progression.",

        "Abstract": "Groove pancreatitis is a chronic type of segmental or focal pancreatitis seen to affect the groove, which is the region between the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, and the common bile duct. Despite its incidence remaining unknown, it accounts for 2.7% to 24.5% of pancreaticoduodenectomies performed for chronic pancreatitis. A diverse etiology has been implicated but the exact cause is yet to be identified. As it closely mimics pancreatic malignancy and remains mostly undiagnosed preoperatively, many patients often end up undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Awareness of this entity and early diagnosis will help us address this issue with more conservative measures than by resorting to a morbid procedure such as a pancreaticoduodenectomy. We report a case of a 50-year-old male, a chronic alcoholic, with a two-year history of upper abdominal pain, postprandial vomiting, and weight loss. An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan was suggestive of either a pancreatic malignancy or a possibility of groove pancreatitis. However, postoperative histopathological examination confirmed the lesser known groove pancreatitis. Here, we review the clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of groove pancreatitis, as its diagnosis and management still pose a challenge.",

Investigations revealed a neutrophilic leucocytosis, and contrast-enhanced CT had shown several well-defined peripherally enhancing thick-walled cystic lesions with non-enhancing centres throughout the liver suggestive of pyogenic liver abscess, treated initially with antibiotics. However, ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration revealed atypical neoplastic cells, and a trucut biopsy showed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). He developed acute shortness of breath. CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Incidentally, here we saw a solitary nodule in the right middle lobe, probably a neoplastic lesion. His condition deteriorated rapidly secondary to PTE and died. A pathological review was positive for CK7, p40, p63 and CK19 confirming SCC. We concluded the primary was a pulmonary SCC with multiple hepatic metastases. Hepatic metastases can mimic an abscess; trucut biopsy with immunohistochemistry was critical for a definitive diagnosis.",

It is believed that the number of patients being diagnosed globally is increasing. To describe the frequency and clinicopathological features of EoE in Jordanian children. A retrospective review of all paediatric patients with eosinophilic esophagitis diagnosed and followed up at our paediatric gastroenterology service at King Abdullah University Hospital between January 2015 and January 2020. During the study period, 21 patients were diagnosed with EoE out of 700 diagnostic endoscopic procedures. Only 1 (4.8%) female was diagnosed. The average age at presentation was 9.5 years (age range: 1-16 years). The most common manifestation was solid food dysphagia (15, 71.4%), followed by food impaction and vomiting (11, 52.4% and 6, 28.6%, respectively). Atopy was diagnosed in 10 (47.6%) patients. Four (19.0%) had food allergy, 3 (14.3%) had respiratory allergy, and 3 (14.3%) had combined. Linear furrows and circular rings were the most common endoscopic features - 17 (81.0%) and 10 (47.6%), respectively, while papillary elongation, basal zone hyperplasia, and eosinophilic infiltrate were the most common reported histopathological features. Almost all patients received proton pump inhibitors (19, 90.5%). Steroids were used in 18 (85.7%) patients; local steroids in 11 (52.4%), and oral steroids in 7 (33.3%). Out of the 4 (19%) patients with esophageal strictures, 2 (9.5%) required pneumatic dilatation. Eosinophilic esophagitis is not uncommon in our community. Clinical and histological parameters point to delayed referral and diagnosis. Increasing awareness of this problem will lead to early diagnosis and will decrease complications.",

        "Abstract": "Mucosal healing (MH) has become a therapeutic goal in Crohn's Disease (CD), but its frequent evaluation in endoscopic examination is fraught with several limitations. There is an increasing demand to replace invasive procedures with noninvasive markers of CD. To assess the clinical importance of the recently developed Mucosal Inflammation Noninvasive Index (MINI) in newly diagnosed paediatric Crohn's Disease patients. Out of 60 consecutive newly diagnosed paediatric CD patients, 55 were enrolled in the study. The study examined the relationship between Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD), Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), laboratory findings and the newly developed MINI index. Out of the 55 paediatric patients involved in the study, ileocolonoscopy was successful in 42 patients. In this group there was a strong positive correlation between MINI and PCDAI (<i>R</i> = 0.61; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and a moderate positive correlation between MINI and SES-CD (<i>R</i> = 0.39; <i>p</i> = 0.011). MINI score of 17 points or more indicated severe CD (defined as SES-CD ≥ 16 points) with a diagnostic sensitivity of 90% but with a low specificity of 50%. There were 13 (23%) patients in whom ileocecal valve intubation was not achieved, and in this group the correlation between MINI and PCDAI was also strong (<i>R</i> = 0.66; <i>p</i> = 0.014). The newly developed MINI index is a simple and intuitive clinimetric score that can be considered a useful tool in assessing mucosal inflammation among newly diagnosed paediatric CD patients.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic constipation has significant quality-of-life implications. Modifiable risk factors include insufficient physical activity, depression, decreased caloric intake, and aggravating medication use. Chronic constipation is classified as primary (normal transit, slow transit, defecatory disorders, or a combination) or secondary (due to medications, chronic diseases, or anatomic abnormalities). Evaluation begins with a detailed history, medication reconciliation, and physical examination. Routine use of laboratory studies or imaging, including colonoscopy, is not recommended in the absence of alarm symptoms. Patients with alarm symptoms or who are overdue for colorectal cancer screening should be referred for colonoscopy. First-line treatment for primary constipation includes ensuring adequate fluid intake, dietary fiber supplementation, and osmotic laxatives. Second-line therapy includes a brief trial of stimulant laxatives followed by intestinal secretagogues. If the initial treatment approach is ineffective, patients should be referred to gastroenterology for more specialized testing, such as anorectal manometry and a balloon expulsion test. Patients with refractory constipation may be considered for surgery. Those in whom pelvic floor dysfunction is identified early should be referred for pelvic floor therapy with biofeedback while first-line medications, such as bulk or osmotic laxatives, are initiated.",

        "Abstract": "Therapeutic EUS has witnessed exponential growth in the last decade, but it has been considered investigational until recently. An increasing body of good-quality evidence is now demonstrating clear advantages over established alternatives, adding therapeutic EUS to management algorithms of complex hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) and gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. In this review, the available evidence and clinical role of therapeutic EUS in established and evolving applications will be discussed. A Graphical Summary for each scenario will provide (1) technical steps, (2) anatomical sketch, (3) best-supporting evidence, and (4) role in changing current and future GI practice. Therapeutic EUS has accepted well-established applications such as drainage of symptomatic peripancreatic fluid collections, biliary drainage in failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and treatment of acute cholecystitis in unfit-for-surgery patients. In addition, good-quality evidence on several emerging indications (e.g., treatment of gastric outlet obstruction, local ablation of pancreatic solid lesions, etc.) is promising. Specific emphasis will be given to how these technical innovations have changed management paradigms and algorithms and expanded the possibilities of gastroenterologists to provide therapeutic solutions to old and emerging clinical needs. Therapeutic EUS is cementing its role in everyday practice, radically changing the treatment of different HPB diseases and other conditions (e.g., GI obstruction). The development of dedicated accessories and increased training opportunities will expand the ability of gastroenterologists to deliver highly effective yet minimally invasive therapies, potentially translating into a better quality of life, especially for oncological and fragile patients.",

GIM consultations for diagnosis from other departments on outpatients aged ≧ 20 years from January 2018 to December 2020 were included. Data were extracted from electronic medical records. The primary outcome was new diagnosis rates. The secondary outcomes were new diagnosis rates with clinical significance and clinical outcomes at 90 days from the index visit. A total of 328 patients were included. The top five consulting departments were orthopedics (17.0%), cardiovascular (10.3%), otorhinolaryngology (8.8%), neurology (8.8%), and gastroenterology (7.9%). GIM identified 456 chief complaints (CCs), and the top five were fever (10.9%), abnormal laboratory results (8.3%), fatigue (5.9%), and pain (7.4%) or numbness (4.6%) in the extremities. There were 139 (104/328 patients: 31.8%) specialty consultations from GIM, and the top five departments were rheumatology (21.1%), gastroenterology (19.2%), orthopedics (9.6%), psychiatry (9.6%), and neurology (9.6%). In total, 277 new diagnoses were established in 232 patients (70.7%), and 203 patients had new diagnoses with clinical significance (61.8%). Clinical outcomes at 90 days from the time of the index visit were resolution/improvement (60.7%), unchanged/worsened (22.3%), and unknown (17.0%). Over 70% of GIM consultations from other departments established new diagnoses with favorable outcomes in >60% of the patients.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the association between serological markers and changes of the intestinal mucosa in children with celiac disease (CD). Clinical data from CD patients under 15 years old were collected from the participating centers in an on-line multicenter nationwide observational Spanish registry called REPAC-2 (2011-2017). Correlation between anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (t-TGA) levels and other variables, including mucosal damage and clinical findings (symptoms, age, and gender), was assessed. A total of 2955 of 4838 patients had t-TGA and a small bowel biopsy (SBB) performed for CD diagnosis. A total of 1931 (66.2%) patients with normal IgA values had a Marsh 3b-c lesion and 1892 (64.9%) had t-TGA Immunoglobulin A (IgA) ≥ 10 times upper limit of normal (ULN). There is a statistically significant association between t-TGA IgA levels and the degree of mucosal damage ( P < 0.001), the higher the t-TGA IgA levels the more severe the mucosal damage. Those patients who reported symptoms had more severe mucosal damage ( P = 0.001). On the contrary, there was a negative association between age and changes of the intestinal mucosa ( P < 0.001). No association was found with gender. Regarding the IgA-deficient patients, 47.4% (18 cases) had t-TGA Immunoglobulin A (IgA) ≥ 10 times ULN and a Marsh 3b-c lesion was observed in 68.4% (26 patients). No statistical relation was found between t-TGA IgG levels and the changes of the intestinal mucosa, neither a relation with age, gender, or symptoms. There is a positive correlation between t-TGA IgA levels and the severity of changes of the intestinal mucosa. Such correlation was not found in IgA-deficient patients who had positive t-TGA IgG serology. The results in this group of patients support the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition recommendations about the need of performing a SBB in IgA-deficient individuals despite high t-TGA IgG levels.",

        "Title": "Pediatric Endoscopy Blocks: Enhanced Efficiency and Endoscopist Satisfaction.",
        "Abstract": "Endoscopic procedures are increasingly performed for children and adolescents and these interventions represent a central element of both pediatric gastroenterology (GI) care and revenues. It remains unclear, however, which scheduling paradigm maximizes efficiency of resource utilization and delivery of care in this arena. In this study, we evaluate the impact of shifting from shared endoscopy blocks to individual, provider-specific endoscopy blocks for scheduling endoscopic procedures in our tertiary care academic center. The implemented endoscopy block system involves a single endoscopist performing procedures in an allocated room for the entire half-day period of time, with most providers having 1-3.5 day blocks per month. We analyzed block fragmentation (multiple providers in a single block), block utilization, and procedure volume, comparing the 8-month period prior to implementation of the block system (pre-implementation period) with the 8-month period following implementation of the block system (post-implementation period). Provider satisfaction and perceptions were assessed by survey pre- and post-implementation. Standard descriptive statistics were utilized for analysis. In the pre- and post-implementation periods, 22 half-day blocks were allocated to pediatric GI. In the pre-implementation period, mean utilization of these blocks was 65.9% (range: 47%-77%). In the post-implementation period, mean % utilization was 79.8% (range: 64%-89%). Overall endoscopy procedure volume increased from 279 in the pre-implementation period to 419 in the post-implementation period. Provider perception of endoscopy efficiency was enhanced by the block system, with 68.4% of pediatric GI respondents rating endoscopy as \"efficient\" post-implementation (vs 19% pre-implementation) and 63.2% indicating that the block system directly enhanced efficiency. A total of 63.2% reported increased personal procedure volume and 84.2% reported perceived increase in overall procedure volume with block system implementation. Strategic approaches for scheduling endoscopic procedures carry the potential to enhance efficiency and experience for both providers and patients. Implementation of the endoscopy block system was associated with increased procedure volumes and block utilization as well as a more positive experience for the majority of providers. Schedule adjustments with analysis of associated efficiency and satisfaction metrics can optimize pediatric endoscopy practice.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CeD) autoimmunity and coexisting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present a diagnostic dilemma. Our aims were to describe the phenotype of children with IBD and CeD seropositivity and evaluate provider confidence for diagnosing CeD in this population. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of subjects ≤18 years old with IBD and CeD seropositivity between 2006 and 2020. Subjects were considered to have IBD-CeD if they met CeD diagnosis by serology and histology per North American Society For Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines and if providers suspected CeD as evaluated by a survey. The IBD-only cohort included seropositive participants that did not meet criteria for CeD. Demographic, histologic, gross endoscopic, and laboratory features were compared using Fisher exact test. Of 475 children with IBD, 8 had concomitant CeD, 5 had tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) > 10x upper limit of normal (ULN, P = 0.006), and 8 had villous atrophy (VA, P = 0.003) when compared with 17 seropositive participants with IBD-only. No children with IBD-CeD had esophageal eosinophilia, duodenal cryptitis, duodenal ulceration, or fecal calprotectin >250 µg/g. Factors that contributed to provider uncertainty for diagnosing CeD in IBD included the absence of VA and intraepithelial lymphocytes, the presence of neutrophilic and eosinophilic duodenitis, diffuse ulceration, elevated inflammatory markers, and immunosuppression therapy. Diagnosing CeD in children with IBD continues to be challenging. Although high titers of tTG IgA and VA increased provider confidence for diagnosing CeD in IBD, development of evidence-based guidelines are needed. They should better assess the importance of features atypical of concomitant CeD that contribute to uncertainty.",

Stent migration can result in gastrointestinal perforation, with the most common locations in the sigmoid and distal colon, and may require surgical intervention. We describe the case of a 60-year-old female presenting with an ascending colonic perforation secondary to a dislodged plastic biliary stent placed for palliation of her gallbladder carcinoma. The patient was managed with a combined laparoendoscopic approach by a multidisciplinary team-gastroenterology performed an endoscopic stent retrieval and colorectal surgery identified the location of the perforation laparoscopically and performed colonic serosal repairs. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 4. This case demonstrates a novel minimally invasive laparoendoscopic approach at a high-volume academic center for the treatment of ascending colonic perforation secondary to biliary stent migration.",

We conducted a survey to understand the differences in IEE and colonoscopic resection practices among endoscopists from India. <b>Methods </b> An online cross-sectional survey comprising 40 questions regarding quality control of colonoscopy, IEE, and colonic endoscopic resection practices was circulated through the registry of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology and Association of Colon and Rectal Surgeons of India. Participation was voluntary and response to all questions was compulsory. <b>Results </b> There were 205 respondents to the survey (93.2 % gastroenterologists, 90.2 % male, 54.6 % aged 30 to 40 years, 36.1 % working in academic institution, 36.1 % working in corporate hospitals). Of the endoscopists, 50.7 % had no training in IEE and 10.7 % performed endoscopy on systems without any IEE modalities. Endoscopists with more experience were more likely to use IEE modalities in practice routinely ( <i>P</i>  = 0.007). Twenty percent never used IEE to classify polyps. Sixty percent of respondents did not use dye-chromoendoscopy. Less experienced endoscopists used viscous solutions as submucosal injectate ( <i>P</i>  = 0.036) more often. Of the respondents, 44 % never tattooed the site of endoscopic resection. Ablation of edges post-endoscopic mucosal resection was not done by 25.5 % respondents. Most respondents used electronic chromoendoscopy (36.1 %) or random four-quadrant sampling (35.6 %) for surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease. Surveillance post-endoscopic resection was done arbitrarily by 24 % respondents at 6 months to 1 year. <b>Conclusions </b> There are several lacunae in the practice of IEE and colonic endoscopic resection among endoscopists, with need for programs for privileging, credentialing and proctoring these endoscopic skills.",

        "Abstract": "Guidelines recommend universal mismatch repair (MMR) tumour testing of colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRCs) to screen for Lynch syndrome (LS). However, its implementation remains disjointed and referral for genetic testing dismal, particularly among minorities. We aimed to increase referral, cancer genetic testing and eventually LS diagnosis by developing the CLEAR LS (Closed Loop Enhanced Assessment and Referral for Lynch Syndrome) intervention, a systems approach which in the second phase was automated. This is a cohort study of all patients diagnosed with CRC at an academic centre between 1 January 2012, when implementation of universal CRC testing began, and 31 January 2021. The original cohort spanned through 31 May 2015. Tumour testing included MMR immunohistochemistry, followed by <i>BRAF</i> V600E/<i>MLH1</i> promoter methylation testing when indicated. The intervention included a manual phase (1 June 2015 through 31 July 2018), which systematised pathology screening and cancer genetics (CG) referral mechanisms, and an automated phase (1 August 2018 through 31 January 2021) using computer programming. A total of 249/1541 CRC (17.38%) had MMR loss of expression and 129 (8.37%) qualified for CG evaluation. Referral was 27.58% in the original cohort and 92.1% in the intervention (p<0.001). Patients seen by CG among referred were 27.58% in the original cohort and 74.3% in the intervention (p two-sided<0.001). The distribution of race/ethnicity among patients qualifying and referred for CG evaluation was not significantly different across cohorts. LS diagnosis increased from 0.56% (original cohort) to 1.43% (intervention). Cost per new diagnosis of LS decreased from US$173 675 to $87 960 from original cohort to intervention. Implementation of systematic case identification and referral support mechanisms significantly increased the proportion of patients undergoing genetic testing and doubled the percentage of patients diagnosed with LS with no referral differences across racial/ethnic groups.",

This implementation science study included toilet-trained subjects aged 4 years and older who met the Rome IV criteria for functional constipation. Children were block randomized to receive either the USCAP or control. All clinic functional constipation plans recommended subjects continue pharmacotherapy for 4 months. Endpoints measured were clinical outcomes (resolution of functional constipation and achievement of a Pediatric Bristol Stool Form Scale [PBSFS] score of 3 or 4), patient-related outcomes (health-related quality of life [HRQoL] total scale score), and health confidence outcomes (Health Confidence Score [HCS]). Fifty-seven treatment group subjects (44%) received a USCAP (52% male; mean age, 10.9 [4.9] years) compared with 73 controls (56%; 48% male; mean age,10.9 [5.3] years). A PBSFS score of 3 or 4 was achieved by 77% of the treatment group compared with 59% of controls (P = .03). Subjects from the treatment group were more likely than the controls to endorse adherence to the 4-month course of pharmacotherapy (P < .001). Subjects who received a USCAP had greater improvements in HRQoL total scale score by the end of the project (P = .04). The USCAP is a simple, inexpensive tool that has the potential to improve global outcomes for functional constipation in children and should be recommended as standard clinical practice.",

We evaluated trends in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance and factors associated with completion. Within the national cirrhosis cohort in the Veterans Administration from 2020 to 2021, we captured mortality, outpatient primary care provider, gastroenterology/hepatology (GI/HEP) visits, and hospitalizations. HCC surveillance was computed as percentage of time up to date with surveillance every 6 months (PTUDS). Multivariable models for PTUDS were adjusted for patient demographics, clinical factors, and facility-level variables. The total cohort was 68,073; 28,678 were eligible for HCC surveillance. Outpatient primary care provider and GI/HEP appointment rates initially dropped from 30% to 7% with a rebound 1 year into the pandemic and steady subsequent use. Telemedicine monthly visit rates rose from less than 10% to a peak of 20% with a steady gradual decline. Nearly 70% of Veterans were up to date with HCC surveillance before the pandemic with an early pandemic nadir of approximately 50% and 60% PTUDS 2 years into the pandemic. In adjusted models, use of a population-based cirrhosis dashboard (β 8.5, 95% CI 6.9-10.2) and GI/HEP visits both in-person (β 3.2, 95% CI 2.9-3.6) and telemedicine (β 2.1, 95% CI 1.9-2.4) were associated with a higher PTUDS. Outpatient utilization and HCC surveillance rates have rebounded but remain below at baseline. Population-based approaches and specialty care for cirrhosis were associated with a higher completion of HCC surveillance.",

        "Title": "Differential diagnosis and long-term outcomes of non-atrophic duodenal changes in children.",
        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal endoscopy is often performed when investigating abdominal complaints in children. While atrophic changes of the duodenal mucosa are usually caused by celiac disease, the prevalence and clinical significance of non-atrophic duodenal changes are less clear. We studied these issues in a large pediatric endoscopic cohort. Comprehensive data on clinical features, diagnostic findings and long-term outcomes of children who had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with systematic duodenal sampling were collected. Study variables were compared between children with non-atrophic changes and normal histology, and between those with non-atrophic changes who did and did not receive a diagnosis. The study comprised 1,170 consecutive children, of whom 51 (4.4%) had non-atrophic and 315 (26.9%) atrophic duodenal changes and 804 (68.7%) normal histology. The most common non-atrophic findings were non-specific inflammation (<i>n</i> = 19) and intraepithelial lymphocytosis (<i>n</i> = 14). Patients with non-atrophic changes presented more often with blood in stools (23.5 vs. 11.3%; <i>p</i> = 0.009), anemia (43.2 vs. 36.5%; <i>p</i> = 0.028) and positive celiac serology (34.3 vs. 12.9%; <i>p</i> < 0.001) than those with a normal duodenum. Twenty-four (44%) of those with non-atrophic changes received an initial diagnosis, the most common of which were inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (<i>n</i> = 8), <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection (<i>n</i> = 3) and food allergy (<i>n</i> = 3). The prevalence of the diagnoses did not differ from those with a normal duodenum. Those who received a diagnosis had more often blood in stools (37.5 vs. 11.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.027), anemia (70.6 vs. 20.0%; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and negative celiac serology (50.0 vs. 7.7%<i>; p</i> = 0.013) than those without diagnosis. During a follow-up of 6.1-13.3 years, five of the 12 initially undiagnosed seropositive patients developed celiac disease, and one patient also developed ulcerative colitis. Non-atrophic duodenal changes are relatively common and associated with anemia, blood in stools, and positive celiac disease serology. Excluding potential celiac disease, those without an initial diagnosis have a favorable long-term prognosis.",

        "Title": "Acid-suppressive therapy among infants and risk of anemia at 12 months of age.",
        "Abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that links exist between exposure to acid suppression among adults and nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamin B12 and iron. While the use of acid suppression among children and infants is common, nutritional deficiency remains a concern but does not have numerous studies to support it. We conducted a cohort study to examine this concern; the hypothesis we proposed is that acid-suppressive therapy (AST) during infancy is linked to anemia in the first year of life. This retrospective cohort study included infants born between 2017 and 2018 who visited Legacy Community Health. The inclusion criteria were exposure to acid suppression for a minimum of 1 month and a hemoglobin reading at 12-15 months. Infants who had hemoglobinopathies, failure to thrive, or malabsorption syndromes were excluded. Mean hemoglobin was calculated, and student's <i>t</i>-test was applied to find statistical differences between the two groups. Change in weight before and after treatment was recorded. Occurrence of respiratory and gastroenterological adverse events was recorded in the exposed group. Overall, 135 exposed infants were identified 135 controls were selected. The majority of the sample included Hispanic girls. Ranitidine was the most commonly prescribed medicine. The duration of treatment was 3 months. Weight improved significantly at termination of the treatment. There was no significant difference between the hemoglobin level of cases and controls, and both were not considered anemic. AST was not linked to anemia, despite the slightly lower hemoglobin in some cases. There were few weaknesses in our study; therefore, further studies can examine this link by focusing further on medication type and close follow-up. We found that although proton pump inhibitors are considered the first line of treatment, histamine-2 receptor antagonists were more frequently prescribed. Strategies to familiarize general pediatricians with the NSAPGHAN guidelines might be needed.",

        "Abstract": "The role of dairy foods in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been controversial and it is debatable if patients with IBD should avoid milk and dairy products or not, as well as the relationship between these foods and symptoms among those population. This multi centric cross-sectional study designed to evaluate if it is really necessary to deprive IBD patients from consumption of dairy foods. A multicenter study with 12 gastroenterology referral centers in four countries was designed to evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms after consumption of dairy foods from all outpatients with IBD during 6 months and to compare patients treated at the same centers without IBD (non IBD cases). Overall 1888 cases included (872 IBD patients and 1016 non IBD cases). 56.6% of participants were female with average age of 40.1 years. Racially 79.8% participants were Caucasians and originally they were citizens of 10 countries. Relative prevalence of IBD was higher in Africans and Indians and the most frequent prevalence of dairy foods intolerance was seen in Asians. Among IBD patients, 571 cases diagnosed as ulcerative colitis and 189 participants as Crohn's disease. Average duration of diagnosis as IBD was 6.8 years (from 2 months to 35 years). The most prevalent GI symptoms after consumption of all the dairy foods were bloating and abdominal pain. Totally, intolerance of dairy foods and lactase deficiency was more prevalent among IBD patients in comparison with non IBD cases (65.5% vs 46.1%, P=0.0001). But the rate of GI complains among IBD patients who had not any family history of lactase deficiency, history of food sensitivity or both were 59.91%, 52.87% & 50.33% respectively and similar to non IBD cases (P=0.68, 0.98 & 0.99 respectively). The rate of dairy foods intolerance among IBD patients without family history of lactase deficiency or history of food sensitivity is similar to non IBD cases and probably there is no reason to deprive them from this important source of dietary calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients.",

        "Abstract": "Gallstones are the presence of bile clay in the gallbladder or bile ducts. The disease can be asymptomatic or symptomatic and can lead to complications and consequently a worse prognosis, such as acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis. The risk of complications increases after the first episode of biliary colic. A clinical-epidemiological evaluation of patients admitted to a gastroenterology ward of a tertiary care hospital with gallstone-related complications. We evaluated 158 patients admitted through discharge reports and medical records analysis from January 1, 2013, to February 24, 2021. The female sex was predominant (76.6%), and the mean age of patients was 51.6 years. Men were significantly older than women (P=0.005). Most (57.6%) had some comorbidity, the most frequent being systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The mean hospitalization time was 24 days, significantly longer in men (P=0.046) but without a direct relationship with age (P=0.414). The most frequent complication was choledocholithiasis, and 55.7% of patients without previous cholecystectomy had a report of biliary colic before admission, on average 1.5 years previously. A history of a prior cholecystectomy was present in 17.1% of those evaluated. Abdominal ultrasonography followed by magnetic resonance cholangiography was the most frequently performed exam for diagnostic definition. Regarding therapeutic measures, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was necessary for 47.3% of patients without previous cholecystectomy and 81.4% of patients who have already had a cholecystectomy. Among patients not yet cholecystectomized, 84% underwent the procedure before discharge. The female patients were predominant. Men were significantly older than women and had more extended hospital stays. The most frequent complication was choledocholithiasis, and around half of the patients reported previous biliary colic. endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has been necessary for the majority of the patients.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The etiology of this alarming condition is multifactorial. A Recently increasing trend in IBD is noted in our country. The present study was designed with the main objective to assess the incidence and to identify the associated risk factors including demographic, geographical areas, and dietary patterns of IBD population of Northern of Karnataka viz. Hubli-Dharwad city. A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of 226 patients with a working diagnosis of IBD and those who were admitted between 2015 to 2019 the department of gastroenterology, SDMCMS&H. The diagnosis of IBD was made based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histopathologic findings. The patients were categorized into IBD and those who have symptoms suggestive of IBD but did not fit into the diagnostic criteria into, non-IBD groups. The data about of on demography, diet patterns, and laboratory parameters were recorded. Among 226 patients enrolled in this study 2015-2019, IBD was confirmed in 54 Ulcerative colitis - 44 (19.46%), Crohn's disease - 10 (4.42%) patients with varying distribution of disease among different age groups and both genders, Ulcerative colitis (UC) [M: F: 28 (63.6%): 16 (36.4%)] and Crohn's disease (CD) [M: F: 07 (70.0%):03 (30.0%)]. Dietary pattern and other habitats had no significant contribution to illness and its symptoms. Urban (U) and Rural (R) divide was UC [U: R: 32 (72.7%): 12 (27.3%)], CD [U:R:07(70.0%):03(30.0%)] maintained. Incidence of IBD was high with UC as compared to CD. The incidence of IBD among patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of IBD is 19.46% with UC being major as compared to CD (4.42%). Male predominant patterns of IBD incidences were noted. Year by year increasing trend in disease burden was observed. The Dietary pattern has no direct correlation with IBD disease prevalence and incidences.",

        "Abstract": "The Nephrotoxic Injury Negated by Just-in-Time Action (NINJA) program is a multicenter, quality improvement initiative that identifies patients at risk for nephrotoxic medication-associated acute kidney injury (NTMx-AKI). The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the prevalence and types of NTMx exposures and (2) determine the prevalence of NTMx-AKI categorized by service. Exploratory analysis evaluated potential associations between hospital measures and NTMx-AKI. This is a single-center, retrospective chart review of NTMx exposures from January 2019 to June 2020 in noncritically ill children. High NTMx exposures were defined as ≥3 simultaneous nephrotoxins or ≥3 days of either intravenous vancomycin or aminoglycoside. Prevalence of high NTMx and NTMx-AKI rate were normalized to 1000 patient days. A retrospective case-control analysis assessed for potential associations with development of NTMx-AKI. There were 609 NTMx exposures in 565 patients and 44 (7.2%) episodes of NTMx-AKI. The NTMx prevalence rate per 1000 patient days was highest among liver, neurosurgery, and gastroenterology services. The most commonly used NTMx were vancomycin, intravenous contrast, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The NTMx-AKI rate in exposed patients ranged from 0% to 14% across service lines. AKI was most often attributable to vancomycin. Univariable analyses suggest type and duration of NTMx exposure are associated with development of NTMx-AKI but not with severity. NTMx exposures and NTMx-AKI are variable across services. Partnerships with antimicrobial stewardship and multicenter studies are needed to modify NTMx-AKI risk. Ongoing surveillance is needed in patients who do not have normalization of creatinine before discharge.",

        "Abstract": "Climate crisis is dramatically changing life on earth. Environmental sustainability and waste management are rapidly gaining centrality in quality improvement strategies of healthcare, especially in procedure-dominant fields such as gastroenterology and digestive endoscopy. Therefore, healthcare interventions and endoscopic procedures must be evaluated through the 'triple bottom line' of financial, social, and environmental impact. The purpose of the paper is to provide information on the carbon footprint of gastroenterology and digestive endoscopy and outline a set of measures that the sector can take to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases while improving patient outcomes. Scientific societies, hospital executives, single endoscopic units can structure health policies and investment to build a \"green endoscopy\". The AIGO study group reinforces the role of gastrointestinal endoscopy professionals as advocates of sustainability in digestive endoscopy. The \"green endoscopy\" can shape a more sustainable health service and lead to an equitable, climate-smart, and healthier future.",

        "Title": "Faecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of recurrent intestinal Clostridioides difficile infection - a ten-year single-center experience.",
        "Abstract": "Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile in older taxonomy) is a gram-positive anaerobic and bacteria enabled by endospores. Clostridioides difficile is currently the main cause of nosocomial infections in developed countries. Due to the high probability of developing bacterial resistance to treatment and the numerous recurrences in multiple chronic conditions in older adults of our society it causes a widespread medical problem. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective method for treating recurrent intestinal Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). With this method the potential mechanism of effect is the transmission of a complex intestinal ecosystem, including vital microorganisms, from the donor to the recipient. Presenting the results of monocentric prospective monitoring: Primary aim of the study was to evaluate long-term remission (the continued absence of clinical manifestations of CDI 3 months after FMT administration). The secondary aim of the study was to monitor the short-term remission in the 7 days after FMT administration. Demographic data, information about CDI and the details of therapy were obtained and completed by the treating physician of each patient or by targeted questioning of the patient or their family. We used clinical monitoring to determine the effect of the treatment. The examinations of stool donors and the preparation for a faecal microbiota transplantation were performed according to the currently valid guidelines of the Czech Society of Infectious Diseases for the treatment of the recurrent bacterial infection Clostridioides difficile with faecal microbiota transplantation. The follow-ups took place from February 2011 to July 2021 in the gastroenterology department at the AGEL Ostrava-Vítkovice Hospital and included 116 patients with their first and subsequent recurrence of CDI that were treated with faecal bacteriotherapy. The median age of our patients was 71 years old (the youngest was 19 years old, the oldest 103 years old). 69 women and 47 men took part in the study. 56 patients had their first recurrence of CDI, 41 had a second attack, and 20 patients had a third and subsequent recurrences. In 62 patients (53.4 %), the route of FMT administration was a local enema into the left colon. With 37 patients (31.9 %) we used a colonoscopy after standard anterograde bowel preparation. With 12 patients (10.3 %) gastroscopy administration (deep into the duodenum) was used. 4 patients (3.5 %) were given a nasoenteral tube and one patient (0.9 %) was administered FMT per percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). We applied a frozen universal donor FMT in 81 patients (69.8 %), and a freshly prepared FMT from a person living in the same household was used in 35 patients (30.1 %). The secondary endpoint (the absence of clinical manifestations of CDI within 7 days of FMT administration) was achieved with 102 patients (87.9 %) in our study. The fulfilment of the primary endpoint (the development of long-term remission) was observed with 93 patients (80.2 %). An early administration of FMT appears to be a significant predictor of treatment effect (p = 0.05; OR 5.11; 95% CI 1.65-15.8). Faecal microbiota transplantation is an effective and safe therapy for recurrent intestinal Clostridioides difficile infection, and it respects the up-to-date guidelines for treatment. Of the 116 patients included in our study with first and subsequent CDI, we achieved long-term remission in 80.2 % of them. An early administration of FMT appears to be a significant predictor of treatment effect.",

        "Title": "Secondary bile acids mediate high-fat diet-induced upregulation of R-spondin 3 and intestinal epithelial proliferation.",
        "Abstract": "A high-fat diet (HFD) contributes to the increased incidence of colorectal cancer, but the mechanisms are unclear. We found that R-spondin 3 (Rspo3), a ligand for leucine-rich, repeat-containing GPCR 4 and 5 (LGR4 and LGR5), was the main subtype of R-spondins and was produced by myofibroblasts beneath the crypts in the intestine. HFD upregulated colonic Rspo3, LGR4, LGR5, and β-catenin gene expression in specific pathogen-free rodents, but not in germ-free mice, and the upregulations were prevented by the bile acid (BA) binder cholestyramine or antibiotic treatment, indicating mediation by both BA and gut microbiota. Cholestyramine or antibiotic treatments prevented HFD-induced enrichment of members of the Lachnospiraceae and Rumincoccaceae, which can transform primary BA into secondary BA. Oral administration of deoxycholic acid (DCA), or inoculation of a combination of the BA deconjugator Lactobacillus plantarum and 7α-dehydroxylase-containing Clostridium scindens with an HFD to germ-free mice increased serum DCA and colonic Rspo3 mRNA levels, indicating that formation of secondary BA by gut microbiota is responsible for HFD-induced upregulation of Rspo3. In primary myofibroblasts, DCA increased Rspo3 mRNA via TGR5. Finally, we showed that cholestyramine or conditional deletion of Rspo3 prevented HFD- or DCA-induced intestinal proliferation. We conclude that secondary BA is responsible for HFD-induced upregulation of Rspo3, which, in turn, mediates HFD-induced intestinal epithelial proliferation.",

        "Abstract": "The stomach corpus epithelium is organized into anatomical units that consist of glands and pits. Mechanisms that control the cellular organization of corpus glands and enable their recovery upon injury are not well understood. R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) is a WNT-signaling enhancer that regulates stem cell behavior in different organs. Here, we investigated the function of RSPO3 in the corpus during homeostasis, upon chief and/or parietal cell loss, and during chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. Using organoid culture and conditional mouse models, we demonstrate that RSPO3 is a critical driver of secretory cell differentiation in the corpus gland toward parietal and chief cells, while its absence promoted pit cell differentiation. Acute loss of chief and parietal cells induced by high dose tamoxifen - or merely the depletion of LGR5+ chief cells - caused an upregulation of RSPO3 expression, which was required for the initiation of a coordinated regenerative response via the activation of yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling. This response enabled a rapid recovery of the injured secretory gland cells. However, in the context of chronic H. pylori infection, the R-spondin-driven regeneration was maintained long term, promoting severe glandular hyperproliferation and the development of premalignant metaplasia.",

        "Abstract": "Transient Pseudohypoaldosteronism (TPHA) is a very rare condition usually secondary to urinary tract malformations (UTM) and/or urinary tract infection (UTI). It is characterized by hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated plasma aldosterone levels. Given that the predominant manifestations of TPHA patients are digestive tract symptoms, such as poor appetite, vomiting, and weight gain, it is easily misdiagnosed as digestive tract diseases. Two children with poor appetite and vomiting were admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, from 2020 to 2021. Laboratory test results of these two children revealed hyponatremia (< 135.00 mmol/L), hyperkalemia (> 5.50 mmol/L), and hyperaldosteronism (> 180.00 ng/L). Moreover, genetic tests demonstrated no genetic variants highly associated with the phenotype in both cases. The two patients were subsequently treated with electrolyte correction. One of them also treated with antibiotics and one of them underwent surgery. They were followed for 8 and 4 months, respectively. No complications were observed during the follow-up period. This review aimed to outline both cases with parental consent. Transient pseudohypoaldosteronism should be considered in children younger than 6 months, presenting with vomiting, poor appetite, unexplained hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, elevated aldosterone levels, and urethral malformation or urinary tract infection. Furthermore, attention should be paid to whether salt supplementation or anti-infection therapy is effective.",

Department of Gastroenterology, Zonguldak Bulent Ecevit University, Faculty of Medicine, Zonguldak, Turkey, from January 2017 to January 2022. Clinical data of 204 patients with gastric cancer were reviewed. The median value of the HALP score of 23.87, was considered to be cut-off. According to this cut-off value, patients are separated into two categories. Kaplan-Meier method was used to identify factors associated with the overall survival. There was no statistical difference in the mean HALP score according to gender, tumour localisation, histological type, TNM stage, and adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy groups. The mean HALP score was significantly lower in those older than 64 years (p=0.04). When all the patients were divided into the low and high HALP scores, gender, age, histological subtypes, tumour location, adjuvant or palliative treatment status, TNM stage, CEA, and CA19-9 levels were statistically similar between the two groups. A significant difference was found in overall survival of the patients with low and high HALP groups (p=0.05). There was an insignificant difference in the overall survival of those with low and high HALP scores in the adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy groups.

Three classic features include the presence of a genuine sarcomatous component, no transitional zone between carcinomatous and sarcomatous components, and immunohistochemistry of the sarcomatous component that is positive for mesenchymal markers and negative for epithelial markers. Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract is rare but more commonly found within the stomach, gallbladder, and esophagus. Small bowel involvement is very rare.",

This was a retrospective chart review between January 2010 and December 2019 of patients seen in the complex care clinic at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). Data collected included sex, underlying diagnosis, family history of pancreatitis, type of pancreatitis, signs/symptoms, abdominal imaging, severity of attack, and presence of various risk factors associated with pancreatitis. Severity and diagnosis of pancreatitis was determined based on North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. One hundred and twelve patients from both institutions were included, 62% from NCH, median age 11.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 5-16 years], 50% male. Most patients were less than 18 years of age with a median age of 8 years (IQR: 4-13 years). Underlying diagnoses included seizures (67%), cerebral palsy/spastic quadriplegia (65%), diabetes (3.6%), and mitochondrial disease (3%). Majority of patients were found to have multiple underlying diagnoses (88%). Incidence of pancreatitis for both institutions was 336 of 100,000 patients/year which is significantly higher than the general pediatric population ( P < 0.0001). Majority of first episodes of pancreatitis were mild (82%) with abdominal pain as the predominant symptom (50%). Adult patients were more likely to have pancreatitis related to medication use than pediatric patients (70% vs 38%, respectively P = 0.007). Individuals in the CMC population at our institutions have a high incidence of pancreatitis with unique risk factors compared to the general pediatric/young adult populations.",

        "Abstract": "In 2019, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) established a new requirement that all hospitals publish information on the standard costs of services provided. Increased price transparency allows patients to compare healthcare costs and make informed decisions about their care. We investigated compliance with this rule with regards to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a commonly performed operation and one of the 70 shoppable services (SSs) included in the CMS requirement, among prominent hospitals in the United States. The 2021-2022 US News \"Best Hospitals for Gastroenterology and GI Surgery\" was used to identify the top 50 hospitals for gastrointestinal surgery. Each hospital's website was assessed for the presence of a machine-readable file (MRF) as required by CMS. Each MRF was then evaluated for inclusion of all seven required elements: description of item/service, gross charge, payer-specific negotiated charge, deidentified minimum and maximum negotiated charges, discounted cash price, and billing code. The presence of a consumer-friendly display of SSs was also evaluated. The Current Procedural Terminology code 47562 (removal of gallbladder with an endoscope) was used to search for all six required elements: payer-specific negotiated charge, discounted cash price, de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges, campus location of the SS, and billing code. The SS display was further evaluated for provision of additional information on ancillary charges, which are recommended but not required. The MRF and SS were also evaluated for accessibility and date of last update. Hospitals were analyzed according to rank. Compliance with CMS requirements was compared between hospitals. Fifty one hospitals were included. Of these 51 hospitals, one (2%) provided all the required information for both MRF and SS, 44 (86%) did not provide all necessary components of both the MRF and SS, six (12%) had all necessary elements of an MRF only, and two (4%) had all necessary elements of the SS only. The MRF was accessible in 80% (41) of studied hospitals and 76% (39) provided a gross charge but just 35% (18) of hospitals included the discounted cash price. The SS specified location for all hospitals, indicated a billing code in 96% (49), and provided a payer-specific charge in 96% (48), but less often provided de-identified minimum (30; 59%) and maximum (30; 59%) charges. Thirty nine (76%) hospitals reported that the listed price included an ancillary charge. There was no significant difference between hospitals in having all required elements of both the MRF and SS or the MRF only or SS only. Hospitals are providing healthcare consumers with standard charge information, although with significant variation in what is disclosed. There is no association between hospital reputation and provision of standard charge information.",

We aimed to determine whether eating habits, lifestyle characteristics, and body mass index (BMI) are associated with gastrointestinal health risk. The Gastrointestinal Health (GIH) test of the World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) and the Roma IV criteria were applied. We obtained information on food consumption habits and aerobic exercise, among other variables. Not exercising regularly, drinking water and eating vegetables less than recommended, having high body weight, and taking symptomatic medication were variables that explained 73% of the probabilities of not having good GIH (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.734). According to Rome IV criteria, women had a 50% higher risk than men of having functional bowel disorder (RR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.45). Among the men studied, eating few or no vegetables and drinking less than 1 L of water daily was more frequent; however, the women had significantly more intestinal symptoms. In addition, constipation was higher among women than men (<i>p</i> = 0.020). All of the above explains the prognostic value of eating habits and the importance of paying attention to body weight to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disease.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background</b>. Monitoring of biological TNF inhibitors is a very important tool to guide clinical decisions using specialized algorithms, especially in gastroenterology. A new chemiluminescent instrument (i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> from Theradiag) could replace ELISA techniques to calculate the dosage of drugs and anti-drug antibodies. In this bi-centric study, we explored the analytical performances of i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> using manual or automated (DS2<sup>®</sup>) ELISA Lisa-Tracker<sup>®</sup> assays, and compared the results. <b>Patients and methods</b>. Intra- and inter-run performances were evaluated with i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> in two different laboratories and for two different ranges of values for infliximab, adalimumab, and their respective antibodies. Patients' samples were used in the labs to compare the results obtained between the new instrument and either the manual Lisa-Tracker<sup>®</sup> or the automated DS2. <b>Results</b>. Intra- and inter-run performances were satisfactory, with values between 1.8% and 16.1% (for inter-run imprecision at low/medium values of infliximab). Results were generally comparable between assays. with the lowest value of correlation at 0.59 (anti-adalimumab dosage between i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> and manual ELISA). Most often, values of drugs and anti-drug antibodies were higher with i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> than with manual ELISA assay, and correlation values were better with automated ELISA. Agreements were globally acceptable, and the lowest coefficients of 0.7 was obtained for adalimumab values between i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> and the two ELISA methods, and for anti-adalimumab values between i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> and manual ELISA. The type of assay can potentially induce a change in the class of patients and lead to divergent therapeutic decisions. <b>Conclusions</b>. The new random-access instrument i-TRACK<sup>10®</sup> presents many advantages in a routine laboratory: rapidity, the possibility of standardization, usability, and expansion of the measurement range. Despite the relatively good agreement of results, it is preferable to use the same assay in longitudinal follow-up of a patient, because quantitative results were not completely equivalent especially for anti-drug antibodies.",

        "Title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Evaluation and Management of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients With Cirrhosis: Expert Review.",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available published evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with suspected acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis. This article provides practical advice for the management of patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury based on the best available published evidence. This best practice document is not based on a formal systematic review. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through the standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology & Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Acute kidney injury (AKI) should be diagnosed when the serum creatinine increases by ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or is ≥50% from baseline or when the urine output is reduced below 0.5 mL/kg/h for >6 hours. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Preventive measures against the development of AKI in cirrhosis include (1) avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), (2) avoidance of excessive or unmonitored diuretics or nonselective beta-blockade, (3) avoidance of large-volume paracentesis without albumin replacement, and (4) counseling patients to avoid alcohol use. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: (A) Investigation is directed to determining the cause of AKI, which can be due to hypovolemic causes (volume responsive, and the most common cause of AKI in patients with cirrhosis); acute tubular necrosis; hepatorenal syndrome with AKI (HRS-AKI) (a functional renal failure that persists despite volume repletion); HRS with acute kidney disease, a type of functional renal failure of <3 months- duration in which criteria for HRS-AKI are not met; or postrenal, which occurs only rarely. (B) The specific type of AKI should be identified through a careful history, physical examination, blood biochemistry, urine microscopic examination, urine chemistry (Na+ and urea) and selected urinary biomarkers, and renal ultrasound. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: A rigorous search for infection is required in all patients with AKI. A diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out to evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; blood and urine cultures and chest radiograph are also required. There is no role for routine prophylactic antibiotics in patients with AKI, but broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started whenever infection is strongly suspected. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: When AKI is diagnosed, diuretics and nonselective beta-blockers should be held, NSAIDs discontinued, the precipitating cause of AKI treated, and fluid losses replaced, administering albumin 1 g/kg/d for 2 days if the serum creatinine shows doubling from baseline. Urine output, vital signs, and when indicated, echocardiography or CVP (if there is a pre-existing central line) should be used to monitor fluid status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the serum creatinine remains higher than twice the baseline value despite these measures, treatment of HRS-AKI should be initiated with albumin at a dose of 1 g/kg intravenously on day 1 followed by 20-40 g daily along with vasoactive agents (terlipressin; if terlipressin is not available, either a combination of octreotide and midodrine; or norepinephrine, depending on institutional preferences) and continued either until 24 hours following the return of the serum creatinine level to within ≤0.3 mg/dL of baseline for 2 consecutive days or for a total of 14 days of therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Terlipressin should be initiated as a bolus dose of 1 mg every 4-6 hours (total 4-6 mg/d). The dose should be increased to a maximum of 2 mg every 4-6 hours (total 8-12 mg/d) if there is no reduction in serum creatinine at day 3 of therapy by at least 25% compared to the baseline value. Alternatively, clinicians can administer terlipressin by continuous intravenous infusion at a lower starting dose of 2 mg/d, which may reduce ischemic side effects and increase the dose gradually every 24-48 hours up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/d, or reversal of HRS. As per Food and Drug Administration restrictions, terlipressin should not be used in patients with a serum creatinine ≥5 mg/dL, or oxygen saturation of <90%. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Oral midodrine when used should be initiated at doses of 7.5 mg and titrated upward to 12.5 mg 3 times daily with octreotide (starting with 100 μg and titrating upward to 200 μg subcutaneously 3 times daily). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Norepinephrine should be used as a continuous intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/h and the dose increased every 4 hours by 0.5 mg/h to a maximum of 3 mg/h with the goal of increasing the mean arterial pressure by ≥10 mm Hg and/or the urine output to >50 mL/h for at least 4 hours. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The risks of ischemic side effects of terlipressin and norepinephrine include angina and ischemia of fingers, skin, and intestine. These side effects may be lowered by starting at the lowest dose and gradually titrating upward. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Fluid status should be closely monitored because of the risk of pulmonary edema with excessive use of albumin. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be used in the management of (A) AKI secondary to acute tubular necrosis; (B) HRS-AKI in potential candidates for liver transplantation (that is, RRT should not be used in patients with HRS-AKI who are not candidates for liver transplantation); and (C) AKI of uncertain etiology in which the need for RRT may be considered on an individual basis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts should not be used as a specific treatment of HRS-AKI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HRS-AKI. Pharmacotherapy for HRS-AKI before proceeding with liver transplantation may be associated with better post-liver transplantation outcomes. Selected patients with HRS-AKI may require simultaneous liver kidney transplantation based on updated Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network listing criteria.",

These QoL outcomes are often patient-reported, and their inclusion in clinical trials supplements efficacy outcomes to provide the patients' perspective. This assese existing literature for completeness of PRO reporting across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PUD. This meta-epidemiological, cross-sectional study that assessed completeness of reporting among RCTs addressing management of PUD. We conducted a comprehensive literature search] to identify RCTs with a PRO as a primary or secondary outcome. These RCTs were assessed for completion of reporting according to the PRO adaptation of CONSORT checklist. RCTs were also assessed for Risk of Bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Masked, duplicate screening of 829 results = yielded a final sample of 35 RCTs. The average completeness of reporting was 32.9% according to the CONSORT-PRO adaptation. Twenty-one (of 35; 60%) of the RCTs were assessed as having 'high' risk of bias and nine (of 35; 25.71%) were assessed as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias. Bivariate regression found completeness of reporting to be positively associated with increased PRO follow-up duration, sample size, and studies with conflicts of interest. RCTs examining the treatment and prevention of PUD with PROs as an outcome measure have deficient reporting and 'high' risk of bias according to the CONSORT-PRO and Cochrane RoB guidelines.",

        "Title": "Rare pathogenic mutation in the thymidine phosphorylase gene (TYMP) causing mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyelopathy.",
        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease is a rare multisystem disorder that mainly affects the digestive and nervous systems. Key features of the disease include cachexia, ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, peripheral neuropathy and leucoencephalopathy. Symptoms most often begin by age 20 and overlap several other Metabolic and endocrine disorders making the diagnosis challenging. It has been determined that MNGIE is caused by mutations in the gene-encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP; previously known as endothelial cell growth factor 1). We herein present the clinical, neuroimaging and molecular findings in a patient with MNGIE caused by a novel homozygous variant of TYMP gene c.1048C>T, which is predicted to result in a premature protein termination (p.Gln350*). TYMP is a gene on chromosome 22q13.33 that encodes TP. This case highlights the importance of good understanding and early recognition of a rare condition like MNGIE, so that the suffering from unnecessary interventional procedures can be avoided and better multidisciplinary care can be implemented for the symptomatic management of the patient.",

Isolated hepatic involvement is a manifestation of sarcoidosis. We report an incidental finding of hepatic sarcoidosis in a hypertensive and diabetic patient who presented with abdominal pain and fatigue. A case report of sole diagnosis of hepatic sarcoidosis from a Gastroenterology service in Port Harcourt metropolis Nigeria. A literature search was made using the words 'sarcoidosis' and 'hepatic' in PubMed Central, Cochrane and Google search engines. From the search results, literature in English were extracted and reviewed. The index case was referred on account of hepatomegaly with associated abdominal pain and fatigue. A diagnosis of isolated hepatic sarcoidosis was made from elevated liver enzymes, elevated angiotensin converting enzyme, sero-negative autoimmune studies, hepatomegaly with liver nodule on abdominal computerized tomography scan and non-caseating granuloma from liver biopsy. There was no evidence of other systems involvement. Hepatic sarcoidosis is rare in African literature more so as no specific laboratory or radiological test is diagnostic. Delayed diagnosis and underreporting of hepatic sarcoidosis are likely in our environment due to the elaborate evaluation needed.",

        "Abstract": "A new classification criterion for diagnosing ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) was proposed at the 2018 Stanford symposium, but limited data exists about the utility of this criterion. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 3826 patients treated at the Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Hanoi, Vietnam, between March 2018 and May 2020. Patients were classified as having normal motility, mild IEM, severe IEM, or absent contractility based on the Chicago classification version 3.0 and the new IEM criterion (severe IEM was defined as having >70% ineffective swallows). We examined the association between these 4 motility subgroups and the presence of erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus, using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The mean age of the study sample was 44.7 years and 66.3% were women. The prevalence of symptoms, hiatal hernia, and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-positive patients was similar in the 4 study groups. The 4-second integrated relaxation pressures and lower esophageal sphincter resting pressures were lower in patients with severe IEM and absent contractility. Severe IEM and absent contractility, but not mild IEM, were significantly associated with Los Angeles (LA) grade B-D esophagitis (relative risk ratio [RRR] for severe IEM 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-2.80; and RRR for absent contractility 2.37, 95%CI 1.12-5.04). None of the hypomotility subgroups were associated with LA grade A esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus. Patients with severe IEM have a high prevalence of severe erosive esophagitis. These findings suggest the need for a more meaningful classification criterion for IEM.",

She later developed an acquired esophageal stricture and tracheoesophageal fistula, which were managed with resection and primary anastomosis when she was in remission. Postoperatively, the patient developed a leak, which was treated conservatively. She subsequently developed a stricture that was treated successfully. On the fourth dilatation attempt and after she was sent home, she presented with persistent vomiting and low-grade fever and became vitally unstable on the same day, after stabilization, upper gastroenterology contrast revealed contrast filling the pericardium. She was managed conservatively with close observation and serial echocardiograms and then discharged home on day 18 in good condition after complete resolution of the pericardial effusion.",

        "Title": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia Masquerading as Decompensated Cirrhosis.",
        "Abstract": "Patients with known cirrhosis who present with anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and confusion are usually presenting with decompensated cirrhosis. We present a patient with known alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with the above abnormalities, initially thought to be decompensated cirrhosis but found to have acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with acute blast crisis. This case was presented as a poster at the American College of Gastroenterology Annual Scientific Meeting held on October 22-27, 2021. A 59-year-old male with a history of compensated alcoholic cirrhosis presented with unresponsiveness. On physical exam, vitals were normal, he appeared lethargic with generalized pallor, and rectal exam demonstrated an empty rectal vault with no blood or stool noted. Labs were notable for hemoglobin 3.1 g/dL, platelet count 41,000/µL, creatinine 5.2mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 242 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 138 U/L, bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, lactic acid 8.5 mmol/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.8, ammonia 51µmol/L. Imaging with CT head was unremarkable and CT abdomen demonstrated cirrhotic morphology of the liver with a small amount of ascites. Upper endoscopy was performed with no evidence of varices. Paracentesis demonstrated a high serum-ascites albumin gradient with low total protein consistent with portal hypertension. He was intubated for airway protection due to worsening encephalopathy. A peripheral smear was performed which showed myeloblasts with no signs of hemolysis. Bone marrow biopsy was subsequently performed which revealed 38% myeloblasts and features of myelodysplastic syndrome suggestive of secondary AML. Chemotherapy was not initiated as he was acutely critically ill and he expired shortly thereafter.  AML can present with symptomatic anemia, bleeding, mental status changes due to central nervous system involvement, organomegaly, and renal insufficiency. Diagnosing AML in the setting of decompensated liver cirrhosis can be difficult as the clinical presentations can be similar at times. Thus, hematological causes should be considered when there is profound anemia with no acute blood loss early in the course.",

        "Abstract": "Background Acute cholangitis results in significant mortality unless treated promptly. The diagnostic grading criteria of the 2018 Tokyo Guidelines (TG18) are used worldwide as the standard for acute cholangitis (AC) management but validation in clinical practice is required. Aim Use of the Tokyo 2018 (TG18) guidelines in improving the diagnostic accuracy and early detection of AC compared to fellow clinical assessment. Methods A retrospective review of patient records from 1/2010-9/2019 seen at Augusta University - Medical College of Georgia with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code \"cholangitis\" and/or ICD-10 codes \"acute cholangitis, other cholangitis, and calculus of bile duct with cholangitis\" was performed. Inclusion criteria were gastroenterology inpatient consult fellow evaluation and clinical diagnosis of AC. A definitive diagnosis of AC was determined following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). TG18 scoring for AC was then performed, categorized as either diagnostic/non-diagnostic, and compared to fellow clinical assessments following definitive diagnosis post-ERCP. Data were analyzed with chi-square testing. Results Two hundred six patients were identified using ICD codes. Ninety-one met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The mean patient age of the overall group was 67 years old (standard deviation of 13.3 years) with males comprising 69% and non-Hispanic white 56% of the study group. TG18 criteria assessment had a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 63% for patients with AC post ERCP (p <0.05). TG18 accuracy was 81%. In comparison, fellow clinical suspicion had a sensitivity of 90.3% and specificity of 0% (NS). Fellow accuracy was 71%. No difference in fellows' diagnosis of suspected AC was noted based on the training year. Conclusion Application of the TG18 criteria for AC reduces the false positive rate and improves diagnostic accuracy, thus decreasing costs along with avoiding unnecessary ERCPs with associated complications.",

In a subset of these patients, we aimed to associate histological inflammatory features of rectal mucosa to faecal calprotectin levels. In a prospective study, faecal calprotectin levels were collected in all 23 PwCF attending our paediatric centre, together with demographic and clinical data. Associations between faecal calprotectin and clinical features were determined. In 11 of these patients, endoscopic rectal biopsies were obtained and the association between faecal calprotectin and histological inflammatory markers was analysed. Statistical analyses included Spearman's correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. Sensitivity and specificity was calculated. Median age of PwCF was 12 years, 19 had pancreatic insufficiency (PI) (19/23). Seventeen (17/23) had elevated faecal calprotectin, and the median value was 88 µg/g (IQR=178 µg/g). Higher faecal calprotectin levels were observed in the PI group (101 vs 30 µg/g, p=0.027). No significant correlation between elevated faecal calprotectin level and body mass index z-score was found. Five patients (22%) reported abdominal pain, three (13%) complained of diarrhoea and three (13%) had constipation, but these symptoms were not associated with elevated faecal calprotectin.Unspecific focal rectal inflammation was found in four patients (4/11). An association between rectal mucosa inflammation and elevated faecal calprotectin was found (p=0.015). Sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 86%. In our PwCF, elevated faecal calprotectin was frequent, particularly if PI, and it was not related to gastrointestinal symptoms or malnutrition. Elevated faecal calprotectin was present in patients with histological evidence of rectal inflammation. Faecal calprotectin may be an indicator of asymptomatic rectal inflammation in PwCF.",

One-year follow-up of a prospective monthly surveillance of new cases of AP in children under 15 years through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) from April 2013 to April 2014. A monthly surveillance of >3700 consultant paediatricians and paediatric surgeons in the UK and Ireland using the BPSU. Children aged 0-14 years with a new diagnosis of AP. The outcomes following AP, including the incidence of complications and comorbidity at diagnosis and at 1 year. Of the 94 new confirmed cases of AP identified in the UK during the study period, 90 cases (96%) were included in the 1-year follow-up. 30 patients (32%) developed further episode(s) of AP. Over one-fifth of patients developed one or more major complication. At initial admission, the most common of these was pancreatic necrosis (n=8, 9%), followed by respiratory failure (n=7, 7%). Reported complications by 1 year were pseudocyst formation (n=9, 10%), diabetes requiring insulin therapy (n=4, 4%) and maldigestion (n=1, 1%). At 1-year postdiagnosis, only 59% of children made a full recovery with no acute or chronic complications or recurrent episodes of AP. Two patients died, indicating a case fatality of ~2.0%. AP in childhood is associated with significant short-term and medium-term complications and comorbidities including risk of recurrence in approximately a third of cases.",

        "Abstract": "There is little literature on the implementation of screening criteria for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). This study aimed to apply IBD screening criteria in a group of patients with SpA without IBD diagnosis and correlate them to endoscopic findings and disease activity. A total of 82 patients with SpA were included. The IBD screening test and ileocolonoscopy with digital chromoendoscopy with magnification and histological analysis were performed. The data were analysed with Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test and multiple correspondence analysis. The major screening criteria found in 48.7% of the patients were associated with a history of infection (p = 0.037). Rectal bleeding was associated with the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, acute inflammation, enthesitis and tissue architecture alteration in the ileum (p < 0.050). Diarrhoea was associated with a higher disease activity score (p = 0.02). Minor screening criteria were associated with painful inflammatory joint (p = 0.05), high disease activity score (p = 0.001) and high calprotectin levels (p = 0.050). Abdominal pain (36.9%) was associated with axial/peripheral compromise (p = 0.017), inflammatory back pain (p = 0.01), enthesitis (p = 0.021), higher disease activity score (p = 0.023) and acute ileum inflammation (p = 0.046). Diarrhoea of 4 weeks and abdominal pain were the most prevalent major and minor screening criteria, respectively, being related to early manifestations of inflammatory bowel compromise and higher disease activity score. This screening test grants a chance of opportune referral of SpA patients from rheumatology to gastroenterology.",

        "Abstract": "This joint position paper of the Committees of Allied Health Professionals (CAHP) and Nutrition (CON) of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) provides a comprehensive guide for health professionals to manage blended diets in children via gastrostomy tubes. A systematic literature search was performed from 1992 to 2021 using Pubmed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and recent guidelines reviewed. In the absence of evidence, recommendations reflect the authors' expert opinion. Final consensus was obtained by multiple e-mail exchange and virtual meetings of the CAHP and CON. Reported benefits of blended diets include reduced GERD and infections, improved defecation, level of alertness and attention span, skin conditions, and appearance of hair and nails. Families report a sense of greater normality. Small case series, cross-sectional surveys, questionnaire-based small case studies, reports of personal experience, and single-center pilot studies are available in the medical literature. A total of 20 recommendations for practice were made based on the results and consensus process. There is little evidence published to formally inform about the potential health benefits or risks of this practice and how to use it in the best way. This leaves health professionals caring for such patients in a relative vacuum regarding what to consider when providing a duty of care to patients and carers who wish to pursue this method of feeding. This article provides guidelines for safe and appropriate use of a BD, but more research is needed.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of intestinal flora in patients with functional gastroenteropathy and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the relationship between intestinal flora and psychological factors. From March 2020 to December 2020, a total of 35 patients with functional gastroenteropathy and generalized anxiety disorder, 30 healthy controls, 16 patients with functional gastroenteropathy, and 44 patients with generalized anxiety disorder were selected from the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University. Fecal samples were collected from each group, and the related psychophysiological factors scales (Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Neurotic Personality Questionnaire, concept of illness questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Severity of Physical Symptoms Scale, and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire) were improved. 16S rRNA high-pass sequencing was used to determine the correlation between intestinal flora changes and functional gastroenteropathy with generalized anxiety disorder. Then, the scale and gut microbiota results were analyzed for correlation to determine the correlation between personality traits and gut microbiota. We found similar intestinal microbiota in patients with functional gastroenterology, generalized anxiety disorder, and functional gastroenteropathy with generalized anxiety disorder. But the relative abundance of Clostridium was significantly increased in patients with functional gastrointestinal disease (FGID) and generalized anxiety. The relative abundance of <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> was significantly increased in patients with functional gastrointestinal disease without a generalized anxiety disorder. The intestinal microecological composition was significantly correlated with personality traits. Functional gastrointestinal disease comorbidity GAD may be related to an increase in the relative abundance of <i>Fusobacterium</i>. FGID non-comorbidity GAD may be related to the increased relative abundance of <i>Hemophilus</i>. The increased relative abundance of <i>Fusobacterium</i> and <i>Megamonas</i> is associated with personality traits such as difficulty describing feelings and difficulty identifying feelings, neuroticism, and negative cognition of disease.",

        "Abstract": "Pregnant patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are frequently treated with immunomodulatory agents and may be at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including peripartum infections. We sought to examine the risk for peripartum infections in patients with IBD compared with control subjects and identify potential risk factors associated with peripartum infections in these patients. This retrospective cohort study compared peripartum infection rates and associated risk factors between pregnant women with and without IBD. The study population included women attending a dedicated joint maternal-fetal medicine and gastroenterology clinic for pregnant women with IBD between 2012 and 2019 at the Rabin Medical Center in Israel, a major referral center for patients with IBD. For each patient, 5 women without IBD were matched according to the newborn's birth date (±2 years), age, parity, and body mass index. Peripartum infection was defined as any 1 of the following: chorioamnionitis, maternal fever (>38°C) detected during labor or postpartum hospitalization, and positive culture taken during the hospitalization. Overall, 195 pregnant women with IBD (72 [37%] with ulcerative colitis, 123 [63%] with Crohn's disease) were matched with 888 control subjects. The mean disease duration was 8.4 ± 7.02 years. IBD therapy, used by 81%, included most frequently 5-aminosalicylic acid (44%) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (27%). Peripartum infections were observed in 15 (7.7%) patients and 49 (5.5%) control subjects (P = 1.00). No medication significantly increased the likelihood of peripartum infection. Cesarean delivery was more likely among women with IBD but was not associated with an increased risk of peripartum infection. Peripartum infections were comparable in patients with IBD and control subjects. These reassuring data augment existing knowledge of obstetrical outcomes in IBD patients and contribute to the discussion between caregivers and patients.",

This molecule has a narrow therapeutic margin, associated with a risk of toxicity, particularly hematological and hepatic. Its complex metabolism is subject to genetic polymorphisms that are reflected in the inter-individual variability observed in the response to treatment and its tolerance profile. Hence, its use requires a good knowledge of this molecule. Treatment is initiated after a preliminary workup, followed by a progressive titration of the dosage while closely monitoring possible toxicities.

        "Title": "Guide mapping for effective superficial photothermal coagulation of the esophagus using computer simulations with ex vivo sheep model validation study.",
        "Abstract": "The transfer and widespread acceptance of laser-induced thermal therapy into gastroenterology remain a topic of interest. However, a practical approach to the quantitative effect of photothermal injury in the esophagus needs further investigation. Here, we aim to perform computer simulations that simulate laser scanning and calculate the laser-induced thermal damage area. The simulation engine offers the results in a guide map for laser coagulation with a well-confined therapeutic area according to laser irradiance and surface scanning speed. The study also presents validation experiments that include histology analyses in an ex vivo sheep esophagus model. The simulation engine was developed based on the Monte-Carlo method and the Arrhenius damage integral. The computational model mimicked laser scanning by shifting the position of the calculated heat source in the grating system along the axis to be scanned. The performance of the simulations was tested in an ex vivo sheep esophagus model at a laser wavelength of 1505 nm. Histological analysis, hematoxylin-eosin staining, light microscope imaging, and block-face scanning electron microscopy were used to assess thermal damage to the tissue model. The developed simulation engine estimated the photothermal coagulation area for a surface scanning speed range of 0.5-8 mm/second and laser power of up to 0.5 W at a 0.9-nm laser diameter in a tissue model with a volume of 4 × 4 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup> . For example, the optimum laser irradiation for effective photothermal coagulation in the mucosa and superficial submucosa depths was estimated to be between 16.4 and 31.8 W/cm<sup>2</sup> , 23.2 and 38.1 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.5 and 1 mm/second, respectively. The computational results, summarized as a guide map, were directly compared with the results of ex vivo tissue experiments. In addition, it was pointed out that the comparative theoretical and experimental data overlap significantly in terms of energy density. Our results suggest that the developed simulation approach could be a seed algorithm for further preclinical and clinical trials and a complementary tool to the laser-induced photothermal coagulation technique for superficial treatments in the gastrointestinal tract. In future preclinical studies, it is thought that the simulation engine can be enriched by combining it with an in vivo model for different laser wavelengths.",

The most significant challenges were accountability for incorrect diagnoses (85%) and potential bias of algorithms (82%). A lack of guidelines (92%) was identified as the greatest barrier to adopting AI in routine clinical practice. Participants identified real-time endoscopic image diagnosis (95%) as a research priority for AI, while the most perceived significant barriers to AI research were funding (82%) and the availability of annotated data (76%). Participants consider the priorities for the BSG AI Task Force to be identifying research priorities (96%), guidelines for adopting AI devices in clinical practice (93%) and supporting the delivery of multicentre clinical trials (91%).

        "Abstract": "All patients with cirrhosis should be periodically examined for esophageal varices (EV), however, a large percentage of patients undergoing screening, do not have EV or have only mild EV and do not have high-risk characteristics. Therefore, developing a non-invasive method to predict the occurrence of EV in patients with liver cirrhosis as a non-invasive method with high accuracy seems useful. In the present research, we compared the performance of several machine learning (ML) methods to predict EV on laboratory and clinical data to choose the best model. Four-hundred-and-ninety data from the Liver and Gastroenterology Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in the period 2014-2021, were analyzed applying models including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression. RF and SVM had the best results in general for all grades of EV. RF showed remarkably better results and the highest area under the curve (AUC). After that, SVM and ANN had the AUC of 98%, for grade 3, the SVM algorithm had the highest AUC after RF (89%). The findings may help to better predict EV with high precision and accuracy and also can help reduce the burden of frequent visits to endoscopic centers. It can also help practitioners to manage cirrhosis by predicting EV with lower costs.",

To assess the association between trainee participation and colonoscopy quality metrics. This multicenter population-based cohort study was conducted at 21 academic and community hospitals between April 1, 2017, and October 31, 2018, among consecutive adult patients undergoing colonoscopy. Procedures performed by endoscopists who did not supervise trainees were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed from April 3, 2017, to October 31, 2018. Participation by a trainee, defined as a resident or fellow enrolled in a gastroenterology or general surgery training program. The primary outcome was the adenoma detection rate (ADR), and secondary outcomes were sessile serrated polyp detection rate (ssPDR), polyp detection rate (PDR), cecal intubation rate (CIR), and perforation rate. A total of 35 499 colonoscopies (18 989 women [53.5%]; mean [SD] patient age, 60.0 [14.1] years) were performed by 71 physicians (mean [SD] time in practice, 14.0 [9.3] years); 5941 colonoscopies (16.7%) involved trainees. There were no significant differences in the ADR (26.4% vs 27.3%; P = .19), CIR (96.7% vs 97.2%; P = .07), and perforation rate (0.05% vs 0.06%; P = .82) when trainees participated vs when they did not participate, whereas the the ssPDR (4.4% vs 5.2%; P = .009) and PDR (39.2% vs 42.0%; P < .001) were significantly lower when trainees participated vs when they did not. After adjustment for potential confounders, the ADR (risk ratio [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91-1.03; P = .30), PDR (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93-1.04; P = .47), and CIR (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78-1.10; P = .38) were not associated with trainee participation, although the ssPDR remained significantly lower (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98; P = .03). This study suggests that trainee involvement during colonoscopy was associated with reduced ssPDR but not other colonoscopy outcome measures. Extra care should be exercised when examining the right colon when trainees are involved.",

        "Abstract": "To establish the epidemiology and patterns of care of Crohn's Disease in low- and lower-middle-income countries. A cross-sectional survey of gastroenterology providers in countries where the world's poorest billion live was conducted to learn more about the state of diagnostic and treatment capacity for Crohn's. Quantitative data were analyzed in R and Excel. A total of 46 survey responses from 15 countries were received, giving a response rate of 54.8%. All responses collected were from providers practicing in Africa and South Asia. The mean number of patients with Crohn's cared for in the last year was 89.5 overall but ranged from 0 reported at one facility in Rwanda to 1000 reported at two different facilities in India. Overall, Crohn's disease made up 20.6% of the inflammatory bowel disease diagnoses reported by survey respondents, with Africa exhibiting a larger proportion of Crohn's compared to ulcerative colitis than Asia. Most providers reported that patients with Crohn's have symptoms for 6-24 months prior to diagnosis and that 26-50% of their patients live in rural areas. The most reported diagnostic challenges are differentiating between Crohn's and intestinal tuberculosis, poor disease awareness, and lack of trained pathologists. The most widely reported challenge in managing Crohn's disease is patients' inability to afford biologics, reported by 65% of providers. Our study suggests there may be a greater burden of Crohn's disease in low- and lower-middle-income countries than is indicated in prior literature. Respondents reported many challenges in diagnosing and treating Crohn's disease.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Aim:</b> Due to the high price of pembrolizumab, it is still unknown whether the use of pembrolizumab for advanced esophageal cancer would be a cost-effective option for patients whose PD-L1 combined positive score is ≥10. <b>Methods:</b> A Markov simulation model was performed based on clinical trial KEYNOTE-181. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to compare the two treatments. <b>Results:</b> The total costs were US$193,575.60 and $8789.24 for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy treatment, respectively. The pembrolizumab group produced 0.93 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), while the chemotherapy group produced 0.58 QALYs. Thus, patients in the pembrolizumab group spent an additional US$184,786.36 and produced 0.35 QALYs more than the chemotherapy group, which resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$527,961.03 per QALY. <b>Conclusion:</b> For patients with advanced esophageal cancer whose PD-L1 combined positive score is ≥10, pembrolizumab is not a cost-effective second-line therapy versus chemotherapy from the US payer perspective.",

        "Abstract": "A 10-year-old female with cystic fibrosis (CF), diagnosed by newborn screen, and pancreatic insufficiency was referred by gastroenterology to endocrinology for short stature (Z-score -3.5 SD). She had poor growth velocity and delayed bone age, although stunting of her growth was evident by age 6 years. Her karyotype was consistent with Turner syndrome (45,X). Growth hormone therapy has improved her growth velocity; she is tolerating it without side effects. At 12 years old, she has delayed puberty due to primary ovarian failure and will initiate estrogen replacement. Her case highlights the importance of a comprehensive evaluation for short stature in individuals with CF. Poor growth velocity and extreme short stature should not be dismissed as expected comorbidities of CF. The differential for causes of short stature is broad, with some etiologies having significant sequalae and increased morbidity beyond that already seen in CF.",

        "Abstract": "Spontaneous transvaginal small bowel evisceration is an extremely rare condition with a few more than 100 documented cases to date. The complications of such a rare entity revolve around its preoperative presentation as well as its operative and postoperative complications. The complications seen are intestinal incarcerations and perforations with an increased risk of post-surgical ileus and peritonitis in a time-dependent fashion. In our case, a postmenopausal female presented with sudden onset bowel evisceration through a defect in the posterior vaginal apex during straining for defecation. Past medical history was significant for intermittent abdominal pain, bloating, and chronic constipation. The patient had no signs of trauma, signs of sexual assault, preceding events, or prior urinary disturbances. The patient was treated surgically with laparotomy and bowel-packing followed by Ward-Mayo's repair with added on anterior and posterior colporrhaphy, and site-specific repair. Postoperatively, following a period of prolonged ileus, the patient made a full recovery. This case report aims to provide a better understanding of the mechanism and occurrence of such an event and also intends to raise awareness of this rare presentation as an emergency condition requiring prompt surgical management.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted training. Gastroenterology higher specialty training is soon to be reduced from 5 years to 4. The British Society of Gastroenterology Trainees Section biennial survey aims to delineate the impact of COVID-19 on training and the opinions on changes to training. An electronic survey allowing for anonymised responses at the point of completion was distributed to all gastroenterology trainees from September to November 2020. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 71.0% of the respondents stated that more than 50% of their clinical time was mostly within general internal medicine. Trainees reported a significant impact on all aspects of their gastroenterology training due to lost training opportunities and increasing service commitments. During the first wave, 88.5% of the respondents reported no access to endoscopy training lists. Since this time, 66.2% of the respondents stated that their endoscopy training lists had restarted. This has resulted in fewer respondents achieving endoscopy accreditation. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused 42.2% of the respondents to consider extending their training to obtain the skills required to complete training. Furthermore, 10.0% of the respondents reported concerns of a delay to completion of training. The majority of respondents (84.2%) reported that they would not feel ready to be a consultant after 4 years of training. Reductions in all aspects of gastroenterology training were reported. This is mirrored in anticipated concerns about completion of training in a shorter training programme as proposed in the new curriculum. Work is now required to ensure training is restored following the pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) is a rare functional gastrointestinal disorder, which has a considerable burden on quality of life of both children and their family. Aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic modalities and therapeutic approach to CVS among Italian tertiary care centers and the differences according to subspecialties, as well as to explore whether potential predictive factors associated with either a poor outcome or a response to a specific treatment. Cross-sectional multicenter web-based survey involving members of the Italian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SIGENP) and Italian Society of Pediatric Neurology (SINP). A total of 67 responses were received and analyzed. Most of the respondent units cared for less than 20 patients. More than half of the patients were referred after 3 to 5 episodes, and a quarter after 5 attacks. We report different diagnostic approaches among Italian clinicians, which was particularly evident when comparing gastroenterologists and neurologists. Moreover, our survey demonstrated a predilection of certain drugs during emetic phase according to specific clinic, which reflects the cultural background of physicians. In conclusion, our survey highlights poor consensus amongst clinicians in our country in the diagnosis and the management of children with CVS, raising the need for a national consensus guideline in order to standardize the practice.",

        "Abstract": "In the setting of increasing attention to representation in medicine, we aimed to assess current perspectives of racial and ethnic workforce diversity and health care disparities among gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology professionals in the United States. We developed and administered a 33-item electronic cross-sectional survey to members of 5 national GI and hepatology societies. Survey items were organized into thematic modules and solicited perspectives on racial and ethnic workforce diversity, health care disparities in GI and hepatology, and potential interventions to enhance workforce diversity and improve health equity. Of the 1,219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]). Suggested interventions were to increase career mentorship opportunities (n = 545 [44.7%]), medical student opportunities (n = 520 [42.7%]), and program and professional society leadership roles for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups (n = 473 [38.8%]). Our survey explored imperative and timely perspectives on racial and ethnic representation and health equity among professionals in GI and hepatology. The findings should inform future interventions to address workforce diversity and establish priorities toward improving health equity, ultimately serving as a springboard for professional societies, academic institutions, and other organizations that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.",

The clinical data including general demographics, clinical presentations, endoscopic and histologic features, treatment and outcome were extracted from hospital medical records. <b>Results:</b> The 7 patients were all males, and the age of onset was 6-12 years. The course before diagnosis was 2-36 months. The most common symptom was rectal bleeding (6 cases) and most common findings at initial colonoscopy were ulcer in 3 cases and protuberance in 4 cases, both located only in rectum. The intestinal histopathology of 5 cases showed characteristic fibromuscular obliteration of lamina propria. Five children were treated with mesalamine granules or suppositories, and 2 cases underwent local excision. The follow-up lasted for 5-24 months and found symptoms relieved in 5 cases, improved in 1 case, and no remission in 1 case. Colonoscopy after the treatment was performed in 5 children, among whom 2 cases achieved mucosal healing. <b>Conclusions:</b> SRUS in children is mainly presented with rectal bleeding, and has characteristic histological change of ulcer and protuberance in endoscopy. Pathology is crucial for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Both the medical and surgical treatment are effective for SRUS.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenic variants (PV) of <i>CTNNA1</i> are found in families fulfilling criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) but no risk estimates were available until now. The aim of this study is to evaluate diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) risks for carriers of germline <i>CTNNA1</i> PV. Data from published CTNNA1 families were updated and new families were identified through international collaborations. The cumulative risk of DGC by age for PV carriers was estimated with the genotype restricted likelihood (GRL) method, taking into account non-genotyped individuals and conditioning on all observed phenotypes and genotypes of the index case to obtain unbiased estimates. A non-parametric (NP) and the Weibull functions were used to model the shape of penetrance function with the GRL. Kaplan-Meier incidence curve and standardised incidence ratios were also computed. A 'leave-one-out' strategy was used to evaluate estimate uncertainty. Thirteen families with 46 carriers of PV were included. The cumulative risks of DGC at 80 years for carriers of <i>CTNNA1</i> PV are 49% and 57%, respectively with the Weibull GRL and NP GRL methods. Risk ratios to population incidence reach particularly high values at early ages and decrease with age. At 40 years, they are equal to 65 and 833, respectively with the Weibull GRL and NP GRL.

        "Abstract": "Socioeconomic disparities adversely affected healthcare use during COVID-19 lockdown. However, trends in these disparities post lockdown are unknown. Therefore, our aim was to study temporal trends and factors associated with gastroenterology healthcare access and disparities during and after COVID-19 lockdown. This cohort study consisted of patients receiving outpatient care in the Cleveland Clinic gastroenterology department between March 2020 and June 2020 and corresponding time periods in 2019 and 2021. Patient demographics and socioeconomic factors were extracted and analyzed. There were 47,031 patients (mean age 56.3±17.6 years, 61.9% female and 76.4% white) included. Patients ≥65 years sought healthcare less frequently during and after the lockdown (40.1% vs 34.8% vs 35.2% in 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively). Missed visits (4.2% vs 10% vs 10.4%), tobacco (11.4% vs 15.9% vs 16.1%), alcohol (38.6% vs 45.5% vs 50.9%), and illicit drug use (3.5% vs 5.8% vs 10.7%) have steadily increased during and after the lockdown compared with prepandemic levels. Factors associated with reduced telehealth use were black race (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99), Hispanic race (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.77)), Medicaid/other public insurance (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95)), unemployed status (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92)), and non-English/Spanish speakers (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.94)). In conclusion, socioeconomic and ethnic disparities persist in healthcare use even a year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an alarming increase in missed visits and substance abuse. Therefore, efforts should be targeted on improving healthcare access for these aforementioned vulnerable groups.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background and Aims:</b> Anti-tumor necrosis factor mAb (i.e., adalimumab, ADA) is currently used in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). However, its regulation on fecal microbiota is still not fully understood. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted on 115 patients with CD who received treatment with ADA for 12 weeks at the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center in Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and Department of Gastroenterology in Shanghai General Hospital. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) evaluation was applied to patients before ADA therapy at week 0, 4, 8, and 12. Clinical remission (CR) was defined as the CDAI < 150. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy or enteroscopy at baseline (week 0) and week 12. Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) scores were calculated by two experienced physicians to assess endoscopic activity. Mucosal healing (MH) was assigned a CDEIS score between 0 and 3. Fecal samples were collected from eight CD patients at baseline and week 12, and the microbiota was analyzed by using 16S RNA sequencing. <b>Results:</b> At week 12, CR was achieved in 70.6% (72/102) of the patients with active CD. A total of 47.1% (48/102) of the patients with active CD attained MH, among which, 56.6% (30/53) of the patients with mildly active CD (3 ≤ CDEIS <9) and 48.0% (12/25) of the moderately active CD patients (9 ≤ CDEIS <12) attained MH, but only 25.0% (6/24) achieved MH in severely active CD patients (CDEIS ≥12). The efficacy of ADA was not associated with lesion locations (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.409, <i>p</i> = 0.815). Unexpectedly, we found an increase in protective microbiota at the genus level (e.g., <i>Barnesiella</i>, <i>Anaerostipes</i>, <i>Tyzzerella</i>, <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae_unclassified</i>) but a decrease in pathogenic bacteria (<i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>) in fecal samples of the ADA-responsive group (ADA-R) when compared with those in the ADA-nonresponsive group (ADA-NR). Notably, the gene <i>bglX</i> coding β-glucosidase and <i>gph</i> encoding phosphoglycolate phosphatase were enriched in fecal samples of ADA-R. Conversely, the abundance of genes coding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter system proteins was significantly enriched in fecal samples of ADA-NR when compared with that of the ADA-R. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study reveals that ADA markedly improves clinical remission and induces MH in mildly to moderately active CD patients and that distinct changes in the gut microbiota can be used to predict the efficacy of ADA.",

        "Abstract": "The quality of bowel preparation is an important factor in the success of colonoscopy. However, the quality of bowel preparation is often affected by multiple factors. The main objective of this study was to explore the specific factors that affect the quality of bowel preparation. Patients were consecutively recruited from the gastroenterology department in Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan from May 2018 to December 2018. All patients were undergoing colonoscopy. Bowel preparation was evaluated by the Ottawa Bowel preparation Scale (OBPS) and all patients were categorized into 2 groups according to the OBPS. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with bowel preparation quality. A total of 910 patients were included in the analysis with an average age of 48.62 ± 13.57 years. Patient source (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and the preparation method (<i>P</i> = 0.029) were correlated with OBPS adequacy. In addition, after stratified by age, preparation method (<i>P</i> = 0.022) was a significant factor among patients under 50 years old; whereas waiting time (<i>P</i> = 0.005) was a significant factor among patients over 50 years old. Bowel preparation should be tailored based on the age of the patients to determine the most appropriate plan, including the most appropriate waiting time and the most appropriate purgative combination. Doctors should also focus more on the quality of bowel preparation in inpatients, who are more likely than outpatients to have an inadequate bowel preparation.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background</b>: The emergence of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has presented a viable non-invasive mean of identifying gastrointestinal diseases in the field of clinical gastroenterology. However, to overcome its extended time of manual inspection, a computer aided automatic detection system is getting vast popularity. In this case, major challenges are low resolution and lack of regional context in images extracted from WCE videos. <b>Methods</b>: For tackling these challenges, in this paper a convolution neural network (CNN) based architecture, namely RAt-CapsNet, is proposed that reliably employs regional information and attention mechanism to classify abnormalities from WCE video data. The proposed RAt-CapsNet consists of two major pipelines: Compression Pipeline and Regional Correlative Pipeline. In the compression pipeline, an encoder module is designed using a Volumetric Attention Mechanism which provides 3D enhancement to feature maps using spatial domain condensation as well as channel-wise filtering for preserving relevant structural information of images. On the other hand, the regional correlative pipeline consists of Pyramid Feature Extractor which operates on image driven feature vectors to generalize and propagate local relationships of pixels from WCE abnormalities with respect to the normal healthy surrounding. The feature vectors generated by the pipelines are then accumulated to formulate a classification standpoint. <b>Results</b>: Promising computational accuracy of mean 98.51% in binary class and over 95.65% in multi-class are obtained through extensive experimentation on a highly unbalanced public dataset with over 47 thousand labelled. <b>Conclusion</b>: This outcome in turn supports the efficacy of the proposed methodology as a noteworthy WCE abnormality detection as well as diagnostic system.",

This study assesses the rate of self-reported ERI occurrence, patterns of injury, and knowledge of preventive strategies in a nationally representative sample of gastroenterology fellows. <b>Methods</b>  A 38-item electronic survey was sent to members of the American College of Gastroenterology. One hundred and sixty-eight gastroenterology fellows were included in analyses. Descriptive and univariate analyses evaluated the likelihood of ERI by workload parameters and gender. <b>Results </b> ERI was reported by 54.8 % of respondents. ERI was most common in the thumb (58.7 %), hand/finger (56.5 %), and wrist (47.8 %). There was no significant difference in the reported occurrence of ERI between male and female gastroenterology fellows. However, female fellows were significantly more likely to report a greater number of body areas affected by ERI, and male fellows were more likely to report elbow pain. Most respondents (85.1 %) reported discussion about, or training in, ergonomic strategies during gastroenterology fellowship. <b>Conclusions</b>  ERI is reported to occur as early as gastroenterology fellowship. Results of this study support this finding and highlight the need for ongoing implementation and monitoring of a formal ergonomics training program as well as development of ergonomically appropriate instruments. Implications of these findings likely extend to trainees in other procedural related specialties like orthopedics and general surgery, though further research is required. Ergonomics training in gastroenterology fellowship and monitoring of its impact on trainees reported ERI is important due to negative effects on productivity and career longevity.",

        "Abstract": "Developments in image-enhancing endoscopy and polyp classification systems have led to a number of gastroenterology societies endorsing an optical diagnosis (OD) approach for small polyps at colonoscopy. In this study we performed a root-cause analysis of ODs to determine the most likely causes of OD error. As part of a prospective feasibility study, DISCARD3 (Detect InSpect ChAracterise Resect and Discard 3), evaluating implementation and quality assurance of a \"resect and discard\" strategy for consecutive small polyps <10 mm, a root-cause analysis of 184 cases of high-confidence OD error was performed. In all cases, histopathology underwent a second blinded review and, where discrepancy persisted, further review with deeper levels. After a root-cause analysis, 133 of 184 true OD errors were identified and classified into 4 types: A (OD, adenoma; histology, serrated), 45/133 (33.8%); B (OD, serrated; histology, adenoma), 55/133 (41.4%); C (OD, adenoma; histology, normal), 19/133 (14.3%); and D (OD, serrated; histology, normal), 14/133 (10.5%). The remaining 51 of 184 errors were because of a pathology error requiring deeper levels (43/184), pathology observer or laboratory error (7/184), or other error (1/184). OD errors can be related to endoscopist-related factors such as poor photodocumentation, failures of current classification systems, and incomplete histology. We identified a subset of serrated polyps frequently misdiagnosed as adenomas (\"pseudoadenomas\") using the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification. An enhanced algorithm for OD is proposed based on the NICE classification including morphologic and adjunct polyp features.",

He underwent an open excisional biopsy, which revealed a necroinflammatory process and no suggestion of lymphoma or an alternative malignancy or specific diagnosis. His steroid treatment was stopped, and he made a good recovery postoperatively. Positive COVID-19 antibodies, positive response to steroids, results and clinical features were consistent with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS-TS), with extensive investigation not offering an alternative diagnosis.While PIMS-TS is a relatively new entity, we believe that this case highlights the importance of it being considered a differential diagnosis of a child presenting with an inflammatory mass.",

The goal of our recent study was to assess somatic symptoms of CMPA and to prospectively observe the effects of a dairy elimination diet using objective parameters and questionnaires. The County Hospital in Szekszárd, Hungary, investigated children aged 1 to 18 who had clinical signs that might indicate CMPA. Stool samples were taken and analyzed using a fecal calprotectin (FC) rapid test (Quantum Blue fCAL, Bühlmann Laboratories, Switzerland) at the time of the diagnosis and following 3 months of an elimination diet. At the baseline visit as well as the first and second follow-up, questionnaires were filled out. Patients were divided into two subgroups according to dietary guidelines based on the results of the questionnaires. A total of 47 patients participated in the study [42.55% female, mean age: 7.36 (SD 4.22) years]. There was no significant difference in FC levels between baseline and after 3-month elimination diet [73.98 (71.12) μg/g and 68.11 (74.4) μg/g, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.331]. After three months, there was a significant decrease in FC levels among patients who adhered to the strict diet [84.06 (79.48) μg/g and 41.11 (34.24) μg/g, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.001]. The findings of our study suggest that FC can be an objective marker in confirming the diagnosis of CMPA. Significant improvement in clinical symptoms and in FC levels can only be expected after a strictly followed elimination diet.",

To facilitate the assistance work of the community pharmacist and its coordination between different levels of care, a group of experts in Community Pharmacy, Primary Care, and Gastroenterology have recently worked on an algorithm to manage these symptoms in the community pharmacy (Professional Pharmaceutical Service). The objective of this study is to analyze the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of patients with heartburn and/or reflux-like symptoms who go to a community pharmacy, and to evaluate the clinical and humanistic results after the implementation of a Professional Pharmaceutical Service. (2) Methods: A pre-post study will be carried out to evaluate clinical and humanistic results after the implementation of a Professional Pharmaceutical Service. We will include 1200 patients who ask for advice or get a non-prescription medication due to acid and/or reflux symptoms in 240 Spanish pharmacies. Clinical data will be collected at baseline and 15 days after the pharmaceutical intervention. The GERD Impact Scale (GIS) questionnaire will be applied to assess changes in heartburn/reflux-like symptoms and quality of life after the intervention.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> The present study aimed to investigate the associations of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B antisense RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1) gene polymorphisms with the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) in Chinese patients. <b>Methods:</b> From January 2012 to January 2021, a total of 207 CD patients and 545 age-and gender-matched healthy controls were collected from the Department of Gastroenterology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The genotypes of CDKN2B-AS1 (rs1063192, rs10757274, rs10757278, rs1333048, rs2383207) were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry technique. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the differences of CDKN2B-AS1 polymorphisms between CD patients and healthy controls, as well as their influences on the clinicopathologic characteristics of CD patients. The analyses for linkage disequilibrium and haplotype were further performed by Haploview 4.2 software. <b>Results:</b> The variant genotype (AG+GG) and variant allele (G) of rs1063192 were more prevalent in CD patients than in healthy controls (32.4% vs 24.8%, <i>P</i>=0.036; 18.8% vs 13.6%, <i>P</i>=0.011). The same conclusions were also drawn for homozygous variant genotype (GG) and variant allele (G) of rs10757274 when CD patients were compared with healthy controls (19.8% vs 12.8%, <i>P</i>=0.017; 45.2% vs 38.1%, <i>P</i>=0.012). According to the Montreal Classification Standards, CD patients were stratified into different subgroups. The homozygous variant genotype (GG) and variant allele (G) of rs10757278 were less frequent in the patients with stricturing CD or penetrating CD than in those with non-stricturing and non-penetrating CD (13.7% vs 29.9%, <i>P</i>=0.015; 37.7% vs 50.4%, <i>P</i>=0.022). However, all the correlations above were no longer significant after Bonferroni's correction (all <i>P</i>>0.05). The polymorphic loci of rs10757274, rs2383207, rs10757278, and rs1333048 were in close linkage disequilibrium with each other in CDKN2B-AS1 gene. Compared with healthy controls, the frequency of haplotype AGAC was decreased in CD patients (1.5% vs 4.5%, χ<sup>2</sup>=7.61, <i>P</i>=0.006), whereas the frequency of haplotype GGAC was obviously increased in CD patients (3.0% vs 0.6%, χ<sup>2</sup>=14.25, <i>P</i><0.001). The stratified analysis further showed that the frequency of haplotype AGAC was higher in the patients with stricturing CD or penetrating CD than in those with non-stricturing and non-penetrating CD (3.1% vs 0.4%, χ<sup>2</sup>=5.31, <i>P</i>=0.021). <b>Conclusions:</b> The variations of CDKN2B-AS1 (rs1063192, rs10757274, rs10757278, rs1333048, rs2383207) may not independently affect the risk of CD. Among the haplotypes constructed by rs10757274, rs2383207, rs10757278, and rs1333048, the haplotype AGAC may reduce the risk of CD, whereas it may increase the risk of stricturing or penetrating in CD patients. In addition, the haplotype GGAC may increase the risk of CD.",

        "Title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Endoscopic Approach to Recurrent Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis: Expert Review.",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide practical, evidence-based guidance to clinicians regarding the role of endoscopy for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide guidance on a topic of clinical importance to the AGA membership, underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC), and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This review is framed around the 8 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, based on the results of randomized controlled trials, observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well expert consensus in this field. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: After an unrevealing initial evaluation, endoscopic ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic test for unexplained acute and recurrent pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast and cholangiopancreatography is a reasonable complementary or alternative test to endoscopic ultrasound, based on local expertise and availability. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: The role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for reducing the frequency of acute pancreatitis episodes in patients with pancreas divisum is controversial, but minor papilla endotherapy may be considered, particularly for those with objective signs of outflow obstruction, such as a dilated dorsal pancreatic duct and/or santorinicele. There is no role for ERCP to treat pain alone in patients with pancreas divisum. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: The role of ERCP for reducing the frequency of pancreatitis episodes in patients with unexplained recurrent acute pancreatitis and standard pancreatic ductal anatomy is controversial and should only be considered after a comprehensive discussion of the uncertain benefits and potentially severe procedure-related adverse events. When pursued, ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy alone may be preferable to dual sphincterotomy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Surgical intervention should be considered over endoscopic therapy for long-term treatment of patients with painful obstructive chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic intervention is a reasonable alternative to surgery for suboptimal operative candidates or those who favor a less invasive approach, assuming they are clearly informed that the best practice advice primarily favors surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: When ERCP is pursued, small (≤5mm) main pancreatic duct stones can be treated with pancreatography and conventional stone extraction maneuvers. For larger stones, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and/or pancreatoscopy with intraductal lithotripsy may be required. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When ERCP is pursued, prolonged stent therapy (6-12 months) is effective for treating symptoms and remodeling main pancreatic duct strictures. The preferred approach is to place and sequentially add multiple plastic stents in parallel (upsizing); emerging evidence suggests that fully covered self-expanding metal stents may have a role for this indication, but additional research is necessary. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: ERCP with stent insertion is the preferred treatment for benign biliary stricture due to chronic pancreatitis. FCSEMS placement is favored over multiple plastic stents whenever feasible, given similar efficacy but significantly reduced need for stent exchange procedures during the treatment course. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Celiac plexus block should not be routinely performed for the management of pain due to chronic pancreatitis. The decision to proceed with celiac plexus block in selected patients with debilitating pain in whom other therapeutic measures have failed can be considered on a case-by-case basis, but only after discussion of the unclear outcomes of this intervention and its procedural risks.",

        "Abstract": "Initiation and maintenance of transcriptional states are critical for controlling normal tissue homeostasis and differentiation. The cyclin dependent kinases CDK8 and CDK19 (Mediator kinases) are regulatory components of Mediator, a highly conserved complex that orchestrates enhancer-mediated transcriptional output. While Mediator kinases have been implicated in the transcription of genes necessary for development and growth, its function in mammals has not been well defined. Using genetically defined models and pharmacological inhibitors, we showed that CDK8 and CDK19 function in a redundant manner to regulate intestinal lineage specification in humans and mice. The Mediator kinase module bound and phosphorylated key components of the chromatin remodeling complex switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) in intestinal epithelial cells. Concomitantly, SWI/SNF and MED12-Mediator colocalized at distinct lineage-specifying enhancers in a CDK8/19-dependent manner. Thus, these studies reveal a transcriptional mechanism of intestinal cell specification, coordinated by the interaction between the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF and Mediator kinase.",

Data on the prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> resistance are limited in Tunisia.<b>Gap statement.</b> Given that <i>H. pylori</i> resistance to clarithromycin has not been studied in Tunisia since 2010, there was a need to determinate its prevalence and the principal mutations implicated in this resistance.<b>Aim.</b> The aims were to define the prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection among symptomatic patients and to determinate the level of clarithromycin resistance among these patients and the main mutations conferring this resistance.<b>Methods.</b> We conducted a cross-sectional study from March 2017 to February 2020 in the Hepato-Gastroenterology Department of Hedi Chaker University Hospital in Sfax that included 124 Tunisian patients who underwent gastroduodenal endoscopy with biopsies. Mutations conferring resistance to clarithromycin were detected using the Allplex <i>H. pylori</i> and ClariR PCR Assay.<b>Results.</b> Out of 124 biopsies, 101 (81.5 2 %) were PCR-positive for <i>H. pylori</i>. Mutations conferring resistance to clarithromycin were detected in 30/95 (31.6 %) of patients. The rate of primary resistance was 25.3 % and of secondary resistance 62.5 %.

        "Abstract": "Paediatric gastroenterology remains an under-recognised sub-speciality in Africa. We determined the preferred sub-specialities among paediatric residents in Southwest Nigeria and what influenced whether they chose paediatric gastroenterology. This was a cross-sectional survey of paediatric residents in seven teaching hospitals in Southwest Nigeria. A self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on their socio-demographics, educational attainment, choice of sub-speciality and the factors influencing that choice. Of 144 eligible paediatric residents, 124 (86.1%) completed the survey. Their mean age was 35.0 ± 1.7 years, and 83 (66.9%) were females. The majority (94.4%) had already chosen their sub-speciality, and nearly two-thirds (65.0%) made the decision during training. The most popular sub-speciality was neonatology (30.6%), and only three (2.4%) residents chose gastroenterology. Factors influencing the choice of sub-speciality were perceived ability (85.3%) and academic experience (83.8%). Financial reasons were less frequent (32.5%). Lack of diagnostic equipment (30.6%) and role models (21.0%) were the most frequent reasons for residents being disinterested in paediatric gastroenterology. Few residents were interested in paediatric gastroenterology and there is a need to encourage interest in this subject at an early stage in their training and provide more diagnostic equipment and greater mentorship.",

        "Abstract": "To form a James Lind Alliance (JLA) Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) to determine research priorities related to the cause, diagnosis, treatment and management of pernicious anaemia (PA) from the perspectives of patients, carers and clinicians. The PSP conducted two surveys and a workshop to identify the Top 10 questions for research. A first survey identified questions relating to the cause, diagnosis, treatment and management of PA. A literature search checked whether any of these questions had already been answered. A second survey asked respondents to identify and rank their top 10 questions from the list of questions from the first survey. An online workshop used an adapted nominal group technique to agree a final Top 10. In the first survey, 933 people submitted 3480 responses that were categorised and summarised to generate a long list of 40 questions. None had been answered by previous research. The combined rankings from the 1068 patients, carers and clinicians who took part in the second survey identified a short list of 16 questions. These were discussed at the final workshop to agree the final Top 10. The number one question was about an accurate and reliable diagnostic test for PA. The other nine questions were about making treatment safe and effective, understanding why people with PA vary in their need for treatment, links to other conditions, and how to encourage clinicians to take PA seriously and provide long-term care. This JLA PSP enabled patients, carers and clinicians to work together to agree the Top 10 uncertainties relating to the cause, diagnosis, management and treatment of PA. Addressing any of these questions will greatly benefit the end-users of research, the people whose daily lives and decisions will be directly affected by generating high quality research evidence.",

        "Abstract": "To elucidate the prevalence of undiagnosed rheumatology-verified diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (RVD-axSpA) in patients attending routine secondary care IBD clinics with chronic back pain. Screening questionnaires were sent to consecutive patients attending IBD clinics in a university teaching hospital. Patients fulling the eligibility criteria (gastroenterologist-verified diagnosis, 18-80 years old, biologic therapy naive, no previous diagnosis of axSpA); and a moderate diagnostic probability of axSpA [self-reported chronic back pain (CBP) >3 months, onset <45 years] were invited for rheumatology assessment. This included medical review, physical examination, patient reported outcome measures, human leucocyte antigen B27, C-reactive protein, pelvic radiograph and axSpA protocol magnetic resonance imaging. A diagnosis of RVD-axSpA was made by a panel of rheumatologists. Of the 470 patients approached, 91 had self-reported CBP >3 months, onset <45 years, of whom 82 were eligible for clinical assessment. The prevalence of undiagnosed RVD-axSpA in patients attending IBD clinics in a secondary care setting, with self-reported CBP, onset <45 years is estimated at 5% (95% CI 1.3, 12.0) with a mean symptom duration of 12 (s.d. 12.4) years. There is a significant hidden disease burden of axSpA among IBD patients. Appropriate identification and referral from gastroenterology is needed to potentially shorten the delay to diagnosis and allow access to appropriate therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Turkey. The current guidelines do not provide sufficient information to cover all aspects of the management of rectal cancer. Although treatment has been standardized in terms of the basic principles of neoadjuvant, surgical, and adjuvant therapy, uncertainties in the management of rectal cancer may lead to significant differences in clinical practice. In order to clarify these uncertainties, a consensus program was constructed with the participation of the physicians from the Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar and Koç Universities. This program included the physicians from the departments of general surgery, gastroenterology, pathology, radiology, nuclear medicine, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and medical genetics. The gray zones in the management of rectal cancer were determined by reviewing the evidence-based data and current guidelines before the meeting. Topics to be discussed consisted of diagnosis, staging, surgical treatment for the primary disease, use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment, management of recurrent disease, screening, follow-up, and genetic counseling. All those topics were discussed under supervision of a presenter and a chair with active participation of related physicians. The consensus text was structured by centralizing the decisions based on the existing data.",

        "Title": "Inactivation of Hippo pathway characterizes a poor-prognosis subtype of esophageal cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Identification of molecular subtypes that reflect different prognoses and treatment responses, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is essential for treatment decisions. We performed targeted sequencing in 201 patients with ESCC to discover genetic subtypes and validate our findings via multiple data sets. We identified 3 driver genes (FCGBP, GRIN2B, and FRY), and recurrent truncating mutations in FRY impaired its tumor-suppressive function and promoted tumor proliferation. A 3-gene mutation signature (FAT1, FAT3, and FRY) recognized a molecular subtype named \"FAT/FRY\" with frequent Hippo pathway-related mutations. In multiple ESCC cohorts, the patients with the FAT/FRY subtype had poorer prognosis than did patients in the WT group. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the FAT/FRY subtype was characterized by inactivation of the Hippo pathway, hypoxia, chemoresistance, higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells and activated DCs, and a transcriptome similar to that of cancer responders. Furthermore, the 3-gene signature predicted better survival for patients treated with ICIs, partially explained by its positive correlation with the tumor mutation burden and neoantigen burden. The 3-gene signature is a biomarker to recognize the FAT/FRY molecular subtype, evaluate prognosis, and select potential beneficiaries of ICIs in ESCC.",

        "Abstract": "Metastatic pancreatic cancer (PDAC) has a poor clinical outcome with a 5-year survival rate below 3%. Recent transcriptome profiling of PDAC biopsies has identified 2 clinically distinct subtypes - the \"basal-like\" (BL) subtype with poor prognosis and therapy resistance compared with the less aggressive and drug-susceptible \"classical\" (CLA) subtype. However, the mechanistic events and environmental factors that promote the BL subtype identity are not very clear. Using preclinical models, patient-derived xenografts, and FACS-sorted PDAC patient biopsies, we report here that the axon guidance receptor, roundabout guidance receptor 3 (ROBO3), promotes the BL metastatic program via a potentially unique AXL/IL-6/phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) regulatory axis. RNA-Seq identified a ROBO3-mediated BL-specific gene program, while tyrosine kinase profiling revealed AXL as the key mediator of the p-STAT3 activation. CRISPR/dCas9-based ROBO3 silencing disrupted the AXL/p-STAT3 signaling axis, thereby halting metastasis and enhancing therapy sensitivity. Transcriptome analysis of resected patient tumors revealed that AXLhi neoplastic cells associated with the inflammatory stromal program. Combining AXL inhibitor and chemotherapy substantially restored a CLA phenotypic state and reduced disease aggressiveness. Thus, we conclude that a ROBO3-driven hierarchical network determines the inflammatory and prometastatic programs in a specific PDAC subtype.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic non-medically indicated PPIs are highly prescribed worldwide. The long-term side effects of PPI must be wisely considered during an extended prescription duration. Our study purpose is to assess the impact of providing patients and physicians with educational guides on the rates of reducing or eliminating PPIs. A controlled study targeting adult patients with chronic PPI use was conducted in a family medicine center in Beirut. Block randomization was employed. Patients (n = 140) were equally divided into an intervention group consisting of a patient-oriented informative and motivational leaflet and a control group having the same follow-up without having the leaflet. All participants filled a questionnaire. All participants received a short phone call in 2 and 6 months. An e-mail clarifying the objective of this study was sent to all physicians and supplemented with a PPI deprescribing algorithm. At the 6-month follow-up, the rate of participants who talked to treating physicians about their PPI therapy was higher in the intervention group (p-value<0.0001), and the rate of participants who stepped down or off PPI was higher in the intervention group (p-value<0.0001). In participants who stepped down or off PPI, the reported breakthrough symptoms decreased over time (moderate: 24.2%, mild: 35.5%, and nil: 40.3% at 2-month follow-up; and moderate: 0%, mild: 55.4% and nil: 44.6% at 6-month follow-up; p-value<0.0001). A low-intensity, low-cost, and easily replicable intervention encouraged a significant number of long-term users of PPIs to reduce or stop these medications without causing significant breakthrough symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "Based on the nursing analysis of children aged 0∼3 in the Department of Gastroenterology, from the perspective of nursing methods and nutrition, bird's nest nursing and high-quality nursing methods were used to intervene children to help them improve their gastrointestinal conditions and sleep quality (Su-Jin, 2021). A total of 2465 healthy children under 3 years were selected, with normal action and intelligence and accompanied by their parents. Among them, there were 635 children in the observation group (O group) and 355 children in the reference group (R group) in the bird's nest nursing group, 572 children in the O group and 603 children in the R group in the other high-quality nursing group. The observation group received routine nursing, while the control group received nest nursing and quality nursing. The height growth rate, weight growth rate, brain weight growth rate, blood cell routine, and serum biochemical examination results of infants aged 6 months and 3 years in the O group, image analysis technology is used to analyze and discuss the gastrointestinal imaging examination of children, so as to conduct more detailed and accurate research. Through the analysis and comparison of the physiological index data of 6-month-old and 3-year-old infants in the observation group and the reference group, and the satisfaction of parents, it was found that the children's physiological indexes, gastrointestinal digestion, weight gain, and brain weight gain rate through bird's nest care and high-quality care were slightly better than those in the observation group, and the parents' satisfaction was also slightly higher. Wei et al. (2020). By creating a comfortable environment and simulating the children's growth environment under the mother's care, it is found that the bird's nest care and high-quality care programs can calm children's emotions, increase children's appetite and digestion, so as to promote children's gastrointestinal digestion and achieve the goal of healthy growth (Wei et al, 2020). Finally, the conclusion is drawn that starting from the needs of children, scientific and correct gastrointestinal care and dietary nutrition should be used to promote the healthy growth of children.",

        "Abstract": "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common malignant biliary tract tumor with the shortest survival from the time of diagnosis. This poor prognosis is due to the destructive biologic behavior of GBC, lack of sensitive screening tests for early detection, and vague nature of first presentation. Here in this study, we will evaluate the baseline characteristics of the patients presenting with gallbladder carcinoma in our population. This retrospective study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology at Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Karachi. Patient data were compiled and composed from the in-patient health records, radiology, and operational records. Those patients with suspicion of GBC, but negative at histology, or patients having inconclusive radiologic findings, were excluded. Baseline characteristics were recorded. Results were presented as means ± SD for quantitative data or as numbers with percentages for qualitative data. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Student's <i>t</i>-test, while categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test. A <i>p</i>-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 162 patients were included in our study. Among them, 101 (62.3%) were females. Hypertension was the most common comorbid illness noted in 29 (17.9%) patients while 91 (56.2%) patients had no concurrent comorbidities. Most common risk factor for carcinoma of gallbladder was gallstones seen in 106 (65.1%) patients. The most common presenting complaint was combination of obstructive jaundice, weight loss with right hypochondrial pain seen in 66 (40.7%) patients. On CT abdomen, direct liver infiltration without lymphovascular invasion was noted in 77 (47.5%) patients followed by liver infiltration along with lymphovascular invasion in 26 (16%) patients and distant metastasis in 24 (14.8%) patients. On gallbladder (GB) mass biopsy, 58 (35.8%) patients had well-differentiated, 46 (28.4%) had moderately differentiated, while 33 (20.4%) had poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Of 162 patients, 103 (63.6%) patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The most common finding on ERCP was proximal common bile duct (CBD) stricture with intrahepatic biliary system dilatation which was noted in 95 (58.6%) patients. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) was performed only in 9 (5.6%) patients. Seventeen (10.5%) patients were managed by simple cholecystectomy, 39 (24.1%) patients underwent extended cholecystectomy, 14 (8.6%) patients underwent chemotherapy, while 102 (56.8%) patients were given palliative management. When followed for 1 year, 101 (62.3%) patients died within 6 months. The baseline characteristics, biopsy findings, modes of treatment, and rates of 1 year mortality were studied in patients with gallbladder carcinoma in our population. Advanced age, high white blood cell counts, and serum bilirubin at presentation with low lymphocyte count and presence of comorbid illnesses were the factors independently associated with increased mortality in patients with gallbladder carcinoma. However, further studies with large sample size and stratification with respect to age, gender, and different variables can be done in terms of mortality in patients with gallbladder carcinoma.

        "Title": "Malnutrition Imparts Worse Outcomes in Patients With Diverticulitis: A Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database Study.",
        "Abstract": "Introduction Studies show that malnutrition can lead to worsening morbidity and mortality in patients. However, to our knowledge, no large database study has been conducted describing the effects of malnutrition in patients with diverticulitis. In this article, we aim to assess the impact of pre-existing malnutrition on outcomes of patients admitted for diverticulitis. Methods Data between 2008 and 2014 from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database were extracted. Inclusion criteria for both groups included patients with a primary diagnosis of diverticulitis using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Exclusion criteria included all patients less than 18 years of age. The test group consisted of patients with a primary diagnosis of diverticulitis and a concurrent diagnosis of malnutrition. In-hospital mortality, length of stay, total cost, and complications, including various forms of sepsis, perforation, bleeding, and GI bleeding, were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to generate odds ratios. Multivariate analysis included age, sex, race, income quartile, and calculated Elixhauser scores. Elixhauser comorbidity scores predicting mortality and readmission were calculated based on weighted scores from 29 different comorbidities. Scores were compared between the two groups using univariate analysis. Results There were a total of 1,520,919 patients in the study, of which 427,679 (2.8%) had a pre-existing diagnosis of malnutrition. On univariate analysis, there was a significant increase in mortality in patients with malnutrition (OR: 10.2, p < 0.01). Additionally, patients with malnutrition appeared to have longer lengths of stay (mean: 12.9, p < 0.01) and greater cost of hospitalization (mean: 194436.82, p < 0.01). Patients with malnutrition had greater rates of sepsis events (OR: 12.0, p < 0.01), perforation (OR: 2.8, p < 0.01), and GI bleed (OR: 1.84, p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, malnutrition appeared to significantly increase mortality (OR: 3.3, p < 0.01). Discussion Patients who present with diverticulitis with malnutrition appear to have significantly worse outcomes. We hypothesize that malnutrition leads to a shift in the gut microbiota, resulting in increased inflammation. As a result, these patients may have an increased risk of worse outcomes, such as sepsis and death. Addressing nutrition in patients with diverticulosis or those with a history of diverticulitis may improve outcomes.

        "Abstract": "Gastroesophageal balloon tamponade (BT) tube placement is a life-saving procedure for refractory bleeding from gastroesophageal varices performed by gastroenterologists, intensivists, internists, and emergency medicine physicians. Despite a recognized need for procedural training, no standard curriculum or assessment tools exist. Given the infrequent performance of this procedure, the development of a representative and accessible simulation model would permit hands-on training to practice and maintain proficiency with BT tube placement. To assess BT tube placement performance before and after a novel simulation-based learning module in gastroenterology fellows and faculty. A 16-item knowledge questionnaire and 22-item procedural skill checklist utilizing a novel 3D printed esophagus model were developed to assess participant knowledge, procedural skills, and confidence prior to our simulation-based intervention and again 8-12 weeks after. Performance metrics were compared pre- and post-intervention within groups and between participant groups. Fifteen gastroenterology fellows (of 15 eligible; 100%) and 14 gastroenterology faculty (of 29 eligible; 48%) completed training. Fellows demonstrated improvement in knowledge (55% to 79%, p < 0.001) and procedural skill (35% to 57%, p < 0.001) following training. Baseline faculty performance did not differ from fellows' performance and post-intervention showed similar improvement in knowledge (61% to 77%, p = 0.001) and procedural skill (40% to 49%, p = 0.147). Overall satisfaction with training was high in both groups post-intervention and faculty felt more confident teaching fellows. The presented learning module offers a unique, low stakes opportunity for learners to improve skills, gain knowledge, and build confidence in placing BT tubes using a realistic simulation model.",

        "Abstract": "The global epidemiology of gastroparesis is unknown. The European UEG and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and motility consensus defines Gastroparesis as a condition characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction, with a symptom pattern of nausea and/or vomiting and overlapping postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). Real-world evidence of this gastroparesis-like symptom pattern is a crucial step in understanding the epidemiology of gastroparesis. In the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study, 54,127 respondents from 26 countries completed the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire and variables associated with disorders of gut-brain interaction via Internet. We selected subjects with gastroparesis-like symptoms (GPLS) (nausea and/or vomiting ≥1 day/week and simultaneous PDS). Patients reporting organic gastrointestinal disease, or fulfilling criteria for self-induced vomiting, cyclic vomiting or cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome were excluded. We determined prevalence, associated comorbidities, quality of life (QoL) (PROMIS Global-10), symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), somatic symptoms (PHQ-12), and healthcare utilization. The global prevalence of GPLS was 0.9% overall and 1.3% among diabetic individuals. Subjects with GPLS showed frequent overlapping of epigastric pain syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Subjects with GPLS had significantly lower body mass index, QoL, more non-gastrointestinal somatic complaints, symptoms of anxiety and depression, higher medication usage and doctor visits in the overall and diabetic population, compared to subjects without these symptoms. GPLS are common worldwide and more common in diabetic patients. The symptom complex is associated with multiple aspects of illness and an increased healthcare consumption.",

A total of 200 inpatients and physical examinees were collected from the Department of Gastroenterology and Endocrinology and Physical Examination Center. The data of physical examination, laboratory examination, and abdominal ultrasound examination were collected. All subjects were randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a verification set (30%). A random forest (RF) prediction model is constructed to predict the occurrence risk of NAFLD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to verify the prediction effect of the prediction models. The number of NAFLD patients was 44 out of 200 enrolled patients, and the cumulative incidence rate was 22%. The prediction models showed that BMI, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ALT, SUA, and MTTP mutations were independent influencing factors of NAFLD, all of which has statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The area under curve (AUC) of logistic regression and the RF model was 0.940 (95% CI: 0.870~0.987) and 0.945 (95% CI: 0.899~0.994), respectively.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy|pancreas enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is the cornerstone in treatment of patients with PEI. In the present study, we use data from the Scandinavian Baltic Pancreatic Club database to examine adherence of PERT according to United European Gastroenterology evidence-based guidelines treatment of CP. Patients with definitive or probable CP according to M-ANNHEIM diagnostic criteria were included. We collected information on exposures, exocrine function, intake of pancreatic enzymes, and markers of nutrition. Fecal elastase &lt;200 μg/g was defined as a marker for PEI. Enzyme replacement therapy of 100,000 lipase units or more was defined as adequate treatment. We included 1006 patients from 8 centers in five countries. Sixty-four percent of the patients were correctly treated. Twenty-five per cent of PEI patients were not taking enzymes at all, and 20% of PEI patients were undertreated with insufficient PERT doses according to the guidelines. Fourteen percent of patients with sufficient pancreatic function were receiving enzymes despite normal exocrine pancreatic function. There were center differences.

        "Title": "Intestinal mucosal barrier in functional constipation: Dose it change?",
        "Abstract": "The intestinal mucosal barrier is the first line of defense against numerous harmful substances, and it contributes to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Recent studies reported that structural and functional changes in the intestinal mucosal barrier were involved in the pathogenesis of several intestinal diseases. However, no study thoroughly evaluated this barrier in patients with functional constipation (FC). To investigate the intestinal mucosal barrier in FC, including the mucus barrier, intercellular junctions, mucosal immunity and gut permeability. Forty FC patients who fulfilled the Rome IV criteria and 24 healthy controls were recruited in the Department of Gastroenterology of China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The colonic mucus barrier, intercellular junctions in the colonic epithelium, mucosal immune state and gut permeability in FC patients were comprehensively examined. Goblet cells were stained with Alcian Blue/Periodic acid Schiff (AB/PAS) and counted. The ultrastructure of intercellular junctional complexes was observed under an electron microscope. Occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in the colonic mucosa were located and quantified using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colonic CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and CD3+ lymphocytes in the lamina propria were identified and counted using immunofluorescence. The serum levels of D-lactic acid and zonulin were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared to healthy controls, the staining of mucus secreted by goblet cells was darker in FC patients, and the number of goblet cells per upper crypt in the colonic mucosa was significantly increased in FC patients (control, 18.67 ± 2.99; FC, 22.42 ± 4.09; <i>P</i> = 0.001). The intercellular junctional complexes in the colonic epithelium were integral in FC patients. The distribution of mucosal occludin and ZO-1 was not altered in FC patients. No significant differences were found in occludin (control, 5.76E-2 ± 1.62E-2; FC, 5.17E-2 ± 1.80E-2; <i>P</i> = 0.240) and ZO-1 (control, 2.29E-2 ± 0.93E-2; FC, 2.68E-2 ± 1.60E-2; <i>P</i> = 0.333) protein expression between the two groups. The mRNA levels in occludin and ZO-1 were not modified in FC patients compared to healthy controls (<i>P</i> = 0.145, <i>P</i> = 0.451, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the number of CD3+ IELs per 100 epithelial cells (control, 5.62 ± 2.06; FC, 4.50 ± 2.16; <i>P</i> = 0.070) and CD3+ lamina propria lymphocytes (control, 19.69 ± 6.04/mm<sup>2</sup>; FC, 22.70 ± 11.38/mm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i> = 0.273). There were no significant differences in serum D-lactic acid [control, 5.21 (4.46, 5.49) mmol/L; FC, 4.63 (4.31, 5.42) mmol/L; <i>P</i> = 0.112] or zonulin [control, 1.36 (0.53, 2.15) ng/mL; FC, 0.94 (0.47, 1.56) ng/mL; <i>P</i> = 0.185] levels between FC patients and healthy controls. The intestinal mucosal barrier in FC patients exhibits a compensatory increase in goblet cells and integral intercellular junctions without activation of mucosal immunity or increased gut permeability.",

        "Abstract": "Rubber band ligation (RBL) using rigid anoscope is a commonly recommended therapy for grade I-III symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. Severe complications of RBL include pain, hemorrhage and sepsis. Flexible endoscopic RBL (ERBL) is now more commonly used in RBL therapy but few severe complications have been reported. Here we report on a case of massive bleeding after ERBL. A 31-year-old female was admitted to the department of gastroenterology with a chief complaint of discontinuous hematochezia for 2 years. No previous history, accompanying diseases or drug use was reported. Physical examination and colonoscopy showed grade II internal hemorrhoids. The patient received ERBL therapy. Five days after ligation, the patient presented with mild hematochezia. On days 7 and 9 after ligation, she presented with a large amount of rectal bleeding, dizziness and weakness. Emergency colonoscopy revealed active bleeding and an ulcer in the anal wound. The patient received two sessions of hemoclipping on days 7 and 9 to treat the bleeding. No further bleeding was reported up to day 15 and she was discharged home. Although the hemorrhoid prolapse disappeared after ERBL, she was dissatisfied with the subsequent complications. ERBL therapy is an effective treatment for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids with satisfactory short and long-term recovery. Pain and anal bleeding are the most frequently reported postoperative complications. Coagulation disorders complicate the increased risk of bleeding. Although rarely reported, our case reminds us that those patients without coagulation disorders are also at risk of massive life-threatening bleeding and need strict follow-up after ligation.",

        "Title": "Guidelines in Gastroenterology: Careful Interpretation Is Essential.",
        "Abstract": "Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) contain recommendations that aim to guide physicians in the diagnosis of and therapeutic approach toward patients affected by gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. These CPG systematically combine scientific evidence and clinical judgment, culminating in recommendations that have been shown to improve patient care. European and North American guidelines published in the area of gastroenterology in 2018 and 2019 were considered for inclusion. To standardize the results, only guidelines that used GRADE as an evidence system were included. Thus, in the end, 1,233 recommendations from 29 guidelines published between 2018 and 2019 were analyzed. Of the 1,233 recommendations collected, 324 (26.3%) had a low level of evidence and 127 (10.3%) had a very low level of evidence, indicating little evidence or expert opinion. Of the 29 publications analyzed, 14 (48.3%) did not present any recommendation with a high level of evidence. Regarding the 1,233 individual recommendations expressed in these 29 publications, only 336 (27.25%) assumed a high level of evidence, with 277 (82.44%) referring to liver pathology. Of the recommendations evaluated, 77 were from North American societies and the remaining 1,156 were European recommendations. In relation to the first group, only 3 (3.9%) had a high level of evidence belonging to the Guidelines for Sedation and Anesthesia in GI Endoscopy. More than 25% of all recommendations currently accepted to guide patients with gastroenterological disorders are based on low-quality evidence or expert opinion. Thus, these documents should guide our performance, but clinical sense and multidisciplinarity must not be overlooked in dubious cases and with weak scientific evidence. Research should focus on the development of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews to improve the evidence supporting the guidelines that guide clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are up to twice as likely to suffer from anxiety and/or depression. Collaborative care management (CoCM) is an evidence-based approach to treating behavioral health disorders that have proven effective for a range of conditions in primary care and some specialty settings. This model involves a team-based approach, with care delivered by a care manager (case reviews and behavioral therapy), psychiatrist (case reviews and psychopharmacological recommendations), and medical provider (ongoing care including psychopharmacological prescriptions). We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of CoCM in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with IBD. Patients with psychological distress identified by clinical impression and/or the results of the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were referred to the CoCM program. Data from our 9-month CoCM pilot were collected to assess depression and anxiety response and remission rates. We obtained provider surveys to assess provider acceptability with delivering care in this model. Though the SARS-CoV2 COVID-19 pandemic interrupted screening, 39 patients enrolled and 19 active participants completed the program. Overall, 47.4% had either a response or remission in depression, while 36.8% had response or remission in anxiety. The gastroenterologists highly agreed that the program was a beneficial resource for their patients and felt comfortable implementing the recommendations. CoCM is a potentially feasible and well accepted care delivery model for treatment of depression and anxiety in patients with IBD in a specialty gastroenterology clinic setting.",

On examination, he had characteristic findings of self-induced vomiting as abrasions and callosities on the dorsum of the right hand and dental erosions. A detailed history revealed that he had 17 years of binge eating with self-induced vomiting. His upper endoscopy showed gastroesophageal reflux grade D with salmon-red mucosal projections, and the biopsy revealed intestinal mucosal metaplasia. This case emphasized the importance of considering upper endoscopy screening for Barrett's esophagus in patients with eating disorders, especially those with self-induced vomiting, as in bulimia nervosa.",

Despite widespread adoption of RFA, the optimal surveillance interval of the ablated zone is unclear. <b>Methods </b> A patient-level discrete time cycle Markov model was developed to model clinical surveillance strategies post-RFA for BE. Three surveillance strategies were examined: the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) strategy based on ACG guidelines for post-RFA surveillance, the Cotton strategy based on data from the USA and UK RFA registries, and the UK strategy in line with surveillance strategies in UK centers. Monte-Carlo deterministic and probabilistic analyses were performed over 10,000 iterations (i. e., representing 10,000 patient journeys) and sensitivity analyses were carried out on the variables used in the model. <b>Results </b> On base-case analysis, the ACG strategy was the most cost-effective strategy, at a mean cost of £ 11,733 ($ 16,396) (standard deviation (SD) 1520.15) and a mean effectiveness of 12.86 (SD 0.07) QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ACG model was the most cost-effective strategy with a net monetary benefit (NMB) of £ 5,136 ($ 7177) (SD 241) compared to the UK strategy and a NMB of £ 7017 ($ 9,806) (SD 379) compared to the Cotton strategy. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of £ 20,000 ($ 27,949), the ACG model was superior to the other strategies as the most cost-effective strategy. <b>Conclusions </b> A post-RFA surveillance strategy based on the ACG guidelines seems to be the most cost-effective surveillance option.",

        "Title": "COVID-19 liver and gastroenterology findings: An <i>in silico</i> analysis of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with liver molecules.",
        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has not only been shown to affect the respiratory system, but has also demonstrated variable clinical presentations including gastrointestinal tract disorders. In addition, abnormalities in liver enzymes have been reported indicating hepatic injury. It is known that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) might infect cells <i>via</i> the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is expressed in several organs including the liver. The viral Spike glycoprotein binds to ACE2 and must be cleaved by Furin and Type 2 Serine Protease to enter the cells. After that, the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is activated and several COVID-19 changes are triggered. To analyze liver and gastrointestinal symptoms and cell signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection due to virus-liver interactions <i>in silico</i>. In this <i>in silico</i> study, the three-dimensional structures of the Akt, mTORC1 and Furin (receptors) were selected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the structures of inhibitors (ligands) MK-2206, CC-223 and Naphthofluorescein were selected from PubChem and ZINC databases. Ligand files were downloaded as 2D structures and converted to optimized 3D structures using ViewerLite 4.2 software. Marvin Sketch<sup>®</sup> software was used to calculate prediction of the protonated form of inhibitors in a physiological environment (pH 7.4). AutoDock Tools (ADT) software was used to calculate and delimit the Grid box used in the molecular docking of each structure selected in the PDB. In addition, protonated ligands were prepared for molecular docking using ADT software. Molecular docking was performed using ADT software tools connected to Vina software. Analysis of the amino acid residues involved in ligand interactions, as well as ligand twists, the atoms involved in interactions, bond type and strength of interactions were performed using PyMol<sup>®</sup> and Discovery Studio<sup>®</sup> (BIOVIA) software. Molecular docking analysis showed that the mTORC1/CC-223 complex had affinity energy between the receptor and ligand of -7.7 kcal/moL with interactions ranging from 2.7 to 4.99 Å. There were four significant chemical bonds which involved two of five polypeptide chains that formed the FKBP12-Rapamycin-Binding (FRB) domain. The strongest was a hydrogen bond, the only polar interaction, and Van der Waals interactions shown to be present in 12 residues of mTORC1's FRB domain. With regard to the Akt/MK-2206 complex there were three Van der Waals interactions and 12 chemical bonds in which seven residues of Akt were involved with all five rings of the MK-2206 structure. In this way, both ASP 388 and GLN 391 bind to the same MK-2206 ring, the smaller one. However, LYS 386 had four chemical bonds with the inhibitor, one with each structure ring, while LYS 387 binds two distinct rings. One of the MK-2206 inhibitor's rings which binds to LYS 387 also binds simultaneously to ILE 367 and LEU 385 residues, and the fifth ring of the structure was involved in a bond with the ALA 382 residue. The hydrogen bonds were the shortest bonds in the complex (2.61 and 3.08 Å) and all interactions had an affinity energy of -8.8 kcal/moL. The affinity energy in the Furin/Naphhofluorescein complex was -9.8 kcal/moL and involved six interactions ranging from 2.57 to 4.98 Å. Among them, two were polar and the others were non-polar, in addition to twelve more Van der Waals interactions. Two distinct hydrogen bonds were formed between Furin and its inhibitor involving GLN 388 and ALA 532 residues. ALA 532 also binds to two distinct rings of Naphthofluorescein, while TRP 531 residue has two simultaneous bonds with the inhibitor. Liver infection and signaling pathways altered by SARS-CoV-2 can be modulated by inhibitors that demonstrate significant interaction affinity with human proteins, which could prevent the development of infection and symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "While variations in quality of care have been described between US regions, physician-level practice pattern variations within regions remain poorly understood, notably among specialists. To examine within-area physician-level variations in decision-making in common clinical scenarios where guidelines specifying appropriateness or quality of care exist. This cross-sectional study used 2016 through 2019 data from a large nationwide network of commercial insurers, provided by Health Intelligence Company, LLC, within 5 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Physician-level variations in appropriateness and quality of care were measured using 14 common clinical scenarios involving 7 specialties. The measures were constructed using public quality measure definitions, clinical guidelines, and appropriateness criteria from the clinical literature. Physician performance was calculated using a multilevel model adjusted for patient age, sex, risk score, and socioeconomic status with physician random effects. Measure reliability for each physician was calculated using the signal-to-noise approach. Within-MSA variation was calculated between physician quintiles adjusted for patient attributes, with the first quintile denoting highest quality or appropriateness and the fifth quintile reflecting the opposite. Data were analyzed March through October 2021. Fourteen measures of quality or appropriateness of care, with 2 measures each in the domains of cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, pulmonology, obstetrics, orthopedics, and neurosurgery. A total of 8788 physicians were included across the 5 MSAs, and about 2.5 million unique patient-physician pairs were included in the measures. Within the 5 MSAs, on average, patients in the measures were 34.7 to 40.7 years old, 49.1% to 52.3% female, had a mean risk score of 0.8 to 1.0, and more likely to have an employer-sponsored insurance plan that was either self-insured or fully insured (59.8% to 97.6%). Within MSAs, physician-level variations were qualitatively similar across measures. For example, statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease ranged from 54.3% to 70.9% in the first quintile of cardiologists to 30.5% to 42.6% in the fifth quintile. Upper endoscopy in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease without alarm symptoms spanned 14.6% to 16.9% in the first quintile of gastroenterologists to 28.2% to 33.8% in the fifth quintile. Among patients with new knee or hip osteoarthritis, 2.1% to 3.4% received arthroscopy in the first quintile of orthopedic surgeons, whereas 25.5% to 30.7% did in the fifth quintile. Appropriate prenatal screening among pregnant patients ranged from 82.6% to 93.6% in the first quintile of obstetricians to 30.9% to 65.7% in the fifth quintile. Within MSAs, adjusted differences between quintiles approximated unadjusted differences. Measure reliability, which can reflect consistency and reproducibility, exceeded 70.0% across nearly all measures in all MSAs. In this cross-sectional study of 5 US metropolitan areas, sizeable physician-level practice variations were found across common clinical scenarios and specialties. Understanding the sources of these variations may inform efforts to improve the value of care.",

        "Title": "Low Prevalence of Endoscopic Screening for Barrett's Esophagus in a Screening-Eligible Primary Care Population.",
        "Abstract": "Despite societal recommendations supporting Barrett's esophagus (BE) screening, it is unknown what proportion of eligible patients is screened in primary care. We assessed the proportion of BE screening- eligible patients evaluated in the primary care setting receiving upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and identified factors associated with undergoing EGD. This was a retrospective study of BE screening-eligible patients, as defined by the American College of Gastroenterology's BE guidelines, in a multipractice healthcare network consisting of 64 internal medicine practices and 94 family medicine (FM) practices. The proportion undergoing EGD, prevalence of BE and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in this group, and patient and provider factors associated with undergoing EGD were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of undergoing EGD. Of 1,127 screening-eligible patients, the mean age was 65.2 ± 8.6 years; 45% were obese; and 61% were smokers. Seventy-three percent were seeing FM; 94% were on proton pump inhibitors; and 44% took ≥1 gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) medication. Only 39% of patients (n = 436) had undergone EGD. The overall prevalence of BE or EAC was 9.9%. Of 39 (9%) referred for BE screening as the primary indication, BE/EAC prevalence was 35.1%. Factors associated with increased odds of having EGD were symptomatic GERD despite treatment (odds ratio [OR] 12.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1-16.3), being on ≥1 GERD medication (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9), and being an FM patient (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1). In this large, primary care population, only 39% of screening-eligible patients underwent EGD. Most of the examinations were triggered by refractory symptoms rather than screening referrals, highlighting a need for improved dissemination and implementation of BE screening.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis, and chronic liver disease (CLD) often suffer from obesity because of coincidence (IBD, IBS, celiac disease) or related pathophysiology (GERD, pancreatitis and CLD). It is unclear if such patients need a particular diagnostic and treatment that differs from the needs of lean GI patients. The present guideline addresses this question according to current knowledge and evidence. The objective of the guideline is to give advice to all professionals working in the field of gastroenterology care including physicians, surgeons, dietitians and others how to handle patients with GI disease and obesity. The present guideline was developed according to the standard operating procedure for ESPEN guidelines, following the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) grading system (A, B, 0, and good practice point (GPP)). The procedure included an online voting (Delphi) and a final consensus conference. In 100 recommendations (3x A, 33x B, 24x 0, 40x GPP, all with a consensus grade of 90% or more) care of GI patients with obesity - including sarcopenic obesity - is addressed in a multidisciplinary way. A particular emphasis is on CLD, especially fatty liver disease, since such diseases are closely related to obesity, whereas liver cirrhosis is rather associated with sarcopenic obesity. A special chapter is dedicated to obesity care in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The guideline focuses on adults, not on children, for whom data are scarce. Whether some of the recommendations apply to children must be left to the judgment of the experienced pediatrician. The present guideline offers for the first time evidence-based advice how to care for patients with chronic GI diseases and concomitant obesity, an increasingly frequent constellation in clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Reports about the implementation of recommendations from acute pancreatitis guidelines are scant. This study aimed to evaluate, on a patient-data basis, the contemporary practice patterns of management of biliary acute pancreatitis and to compare these practices with the recommendations by the most updated guidelines. All consecutive patients admitted to any of the 150 participating general surgery (GS), hepatopancreatobiliary surgery (HPB), internal medicine (IM) and gastroenterology (GA) departments with a diagnosis of biliary acute pancreatitis between 01/01/2019 and 31/12/2020 were included in the study. Categorical data were reported as percentages representing the proportion of all study patients or different and well-defined cohorts for each variable. Continuous data were expressed as mean and standard deviation. Differences between the compliance obtained in the four different subgroups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U, Student's t, ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous data, and the Chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test for categorical data. Complete data were available for 5275 patients. The most commonly discordant gaps between daily clinical practice and recommendations included the optimal timing for the index CT scan (6.1%, χ<sup>2</sup> 6.71, P = 0.081), use of prophylactic antibiotics (44.2%, χ<sup>2</sup> 221.05, P < 0.00001), early enteral feeding (33.2%, χ<sup>2</sup> 11.51, P = 0.009), and the implementation of early cholecystectomy strategies (29%, χ<sup>2</sup> 354.64, P < 0.00001), with wide variability based on the admitting speciality. The results of this study showed an overall poor compliance with evidence-based guidelines in the management of ABP, with wide variability based on the admitting speciality.

        "Abstract": "Strenuous exercise is synonymous with disturbing gastrointestinal integrity and function, subsequently prompting systemic immune responses and exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms, a condition established as \"exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome.\" When exercise stress and aligned exacerbation factors (i.e., extrinsic and intrinsic) are of substantial magnitude, these exercise-associated gastrointestinal perturbations can cause performance decrements and health implications of clinical significance. This potentially explains the exponential growth in exploratory, mechanistic, and interventional research in exercise gastroenterology to understand, accurately measure and interpret, and prevent or attenuate the performance debilitating and health consequences of exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome. Considering the recent advancement in exercise gastroenterology research, it has been highlighted that published literature in the area is consistently affected by substantial experimental limitations that may affect the accuracy of translating study outcomes into practical application/s and/or design of future research. This perspective methodological review attempts to highlight these concerns and provides guidance to improve the validity, reliability, and robustness of the next generation of exercise gastroenterology research. These methodological concerns include participant screening and description, exertional and exertional heat stress load, dietary control, hydration status, food and fluid provisions, circadian variation, biological sex differences, comprehensive assessment of established markers of exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome, validity of gastrointestinal symptoms assessment tool, and data reporting and presentation. Standardized experimental procedures are needed for the accurate interpretation of research findings, avoiding misinterpreted (e.g., pathological relevance of response magnitude) and overstated conclusions (e.g., clinical and practical relevance of intervention research outcomes), which will support more accurate translation into safe practice guidelines.",

Pathogenesis of ICI-induced colitis is not yet clearly explained as it can be disguised as another form such as inflammatory bowel disease or IBD. Recent studies revealed that ICI-induced colitis is a unique form of colitis wherein the synergy of regulatory T cells with the gut microbiome is involved. Diagnosis of colitis can be done via endoscopic lesions and histopathological methods. A patient with colitis can be compared with someone who has IBD. Initial treatment is a corticosteroid. Cooperation between gastroenterologists and oncologists is required to understand further the complete diagnosis and management of different behaviors of ICI-induced colitis. Although immunotherapy provides breakthroughs in treating cancer, adverse effects cannot be prevented and have to be carefully addressed. This study aimed to discuss different biologic therapeutic perspectives in treating refractory immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis. This review provided guidelines, challenges, and suggested protocols for drug immunosuppression.",

        "Abstract": "Episodes of acute ileitis or colitis have been associated with future development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Nevertheless, the rate of future IBD among patients diagnosed with signs or symptoms of acute bowel inflammation is unknown. We aimed to assess the risk of IBD development among patients presenting with signs or symptoms of ileitis or colitis. We searched for all patients that visited the emergency department (ED) and underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) who were eventually diagnosed with IBD during gastroenterology follow-ups within 9 years from the index admission. Multivariable models identified possible predictors of patients to develop IBD. Overall, 488 patients visited the ED and underwent abdominal imaging with abnormal findings, and 23 patients (4.7%) were eventually diagnosed with IBD (19 Crohn’s, 4 ulcerative colitis). Patients with a future IBD diagnosis were significantly younger (28 vs. 56 years, p < 0.001) with higher rates of diarrhea as a presenting symptom (17.4% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.015) compared to non-IBD patients. On multivariable analysis, age (p < 0.001), colitis (p = 0.004) or enteritis (p < 0.001) on imaging and a diagnosis of diarrhea in the ED (p = 0.02) were associated with development of IBD. Although alarming to patients and families, ED admission with intestinal inflammatory symptoms leads to eventual diagnosis of IBD in <5% of patients during long-term follow-up.",

        "Title": "Targeting FAPα-expressing hepatic stellate cells overcomes resistance to antiangiogenics in colorectal cancer liver metastasis models.",
        "Abstract": "Vessel co-option has been demonstrated to mediate colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. The current mechanisms underlying vessel co-option have mainly focused on \"hijacker\" tumor cells, whereas the function of the \"hijackee\" sinusoidal blood vessels has not been explored. Here, we found that the occurrence of vessel co-option in bevacizumab-resistant CRCLM xenografts was associated with increased expression of fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα) in the co-opted hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which was dramatically attenuated in HSC-specific conditional Fap-knockout mice bearing CRCLM allografts. Mechanistically, bevacizumab treatment induced hypoxia to upregulate the expression of fibroblast growth factor-binding protein 1 (FGFBP1) in tumor cells. Gain- or loss-of-function experiments revealed that the bevacizumab-resistant tumor cell-derived FGFBP1 induced FAPα expression by enhancing the paracrine FGF2/FGFR1/ERK1/-2/EGR1 signaling pathway in HSCs. FAPα promoted CXCL5 secretion in HSCs, which activated CXCR2 to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells and the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These findings were further validated in tumor tissues derived from patients with CRCLM. Targeting FAPα+ HSCs effectively disrupted the co-opted sinusoidal blood vessels and overcame bevacizumab resistance. Our study highlights the role of FAPα+ HSCs in vessel co-option and provides an effective strategy to overcome the vessel co-option-mediated bevacizumab resistance.",

Votes from each editorial board member were tallied to identify a consensus list of the 10 most significant topic areas in GI endoscopy over the calendar year of study, with a focus on 3 criteria: significance, novelty, and global impact on clinical practice. The 10 areas identified collectively represent advances in the following endoscopic topics: colonoscopy optimization, bariatric endoscopy, endoscopic needle sampling and drainage, peroral endoscopic myotomy, endoscopic defect closure, meeting systemic challenges in endoscopic training and practice, endohepatology, FNA versus fine-needle biopsy sampling, endoscopic mucosal and submucosal procedures, and cold snare polypectomy. Each board member contributed a summary of important articles relevant to 1 to 2 of the consensus topic areas, leading to a collective summary that is presented in this document of the \"top 10\" endoscopic advances of 2021.",

        "Abstract": "The Rome IV includes a redefinition of functional gastrointestinal disorders and diagnostic criteria. The present study aimed to compare the Rome III and Rome IV classification results and to reveal their differences in children with chronic abdominal pain. The present study is a prospective observational cohort study. Three hundred forty-four children, who were admitted to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic, had abdominal pain for more than 2 months, and were not diagnosed with an organic disease, were included in our study. In children with chronic abdominal pain, Rome IV criteria did not cause a change in the number of patients diagnosed with functional abdominal pain disorders according to Rome III (89.8% vs 89.2%, P >.05). Functional abdominal pain and functional abdominal pain syndrome were the most common diagnoses in Rome III and functional abdominal pain, not otherwise specified in Rome IV. When compared to Rome III, while the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia increased in Rome IV, irritable bowel syndrome decreased. In children with chronic abdominal pain, Rome IV criteria did not cause a change in the number of patients diagnosed with functional abdominal pain disorders according to Rome III, but it caused a diagnostic shift. It was seen that some of the children diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome in Rome III shifted to functional dyspepsia diagnosis in Rome IV.",

        "Abstract": "We aimed to determine the awareness of referring hepatitis C virus patients to the relevant departments and the effect of the pandemic period on this subject. A total of 65 743 patients with anti-hepatitis C virus requests before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were retrospectively screened. Anti-hepatitis C virus-positive patients were divided into 5 groups according to age distribution. The distribution of patients with anti-hepatitis C virus positivity was compared according to age groups, before and during COVID-19. Anti-hepatitis C virus-pos- itive patients who were not requested hepatitis C virus RNA were evaluated individually according to the departments, and hepatitis C virus awareness was compared before and during COVID-19. Anti-hepatitis C virus positivity rate was 1.54% before COVID-19; this rate was 2.15% during COVID-19. When the anti-hep- atitis C virus positivity rate was compared in terms of age distribution according to before and during COVID-19, it was observed that there was a statistically significant decrease in the &gt;65 age group in the COVID-19 period (P = .004). It was found that 216 (32%) of the patients who had anti-hepatitis C virus (+) before COVID-19 and 231 (48.1%) of the patients during COVID-19 were not requested hepatitis C virus RNA test (P &lt; .0001). The departments with the highest awareness of hepatitis C virus were gastroenterology, infec- tious diseases, hematology, gynecology and obstetrics, and oncology, while the departments with the lowest hepatitis C virus awareness were ophthalmology, psychiatry, and general surgery. It was found that chronic hepatitis C virus awareness decreased in all departments during COVID-19. Hepatitis C virus awareness has decreased in all medical departments despite the physician alert system during COVID-19 and also the rate of anti-hepatitis C virus (+) patients decreased in the group aged &gt;65 years during the pandemic.",

        "Title": "Rare case of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to accessory spleen: A case report.",
        "Abstract": "Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) is defined as hemorrhage originating from the gastrointestinal tract proximal to the ligament of Treitz. The causes of UGIH include esophagitis, gastritis, peptic ulcers, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and cancer. However, a rare cause of UGIH, such as an accessory spleen, may lead to serious complications if left untreated and can sometimes be very difficult to diagnose preoperatively. An 18-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of our hospital due to \"repeated black stool for 2 months with aggravation, accompanied by hematemesis for 9 days.\" He denied any history of hepatitis, trauma, or surgery. Laboratory evaluation revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin, 6.4 g/dL). Computed tomography revealed a mass measuring 127 mm in its largest dimension, located in the upper left abdomen, with varicose veins in the gastric fundus. Moreover, distended blue-purple tortuous veins were observed by gastroscopy in the gastric fundus. We believed the mass was likely an abnormally proliferating accessory spleen; however, the causes of severe anemia and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were unknown. After discussion in a multidisciplinary conference, the mass was completely resected laparoscopically, and the subserosal veins in the gastric fundus were sutured using absorbable threads. After the surgery, the patient recovered uneventfully without any complications. Clinicopathological examination showed that the mass was chronic congestive splenomegaly. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage secondary to an abnormally proliferating accessory spleen was confirmed as the diagnosis. Laboratory evaluation revealed hemoglobin at 12.1 g/dL 2 months after surgery. At the 12-month follow-up, the patient showed no recurrence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. UGIH caused by accessory spleen is extremely rare. This entity should be considered in differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Surgical intervention is necessary for timely diagnosis and treatment in case of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in critical clinical situations.",

        "Abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is among the commonest non-malignant admission diagnoses in gastroenterology. Its incidence in Germany lies between 13 and 43 per 100 000 inhabitants and is increasing. In 2017, 24 per 100 000 inhabitants were hospitalized for chronic pancreatitis. From October 2018 to January 2019, we systematically searched the literature for original articles, meta-analyses, and evidence-based guidelines that were published in German or English between 1960 and 2018. 30-50% of cases of acute pancreatitis are caused by gallstone disease, and another 30-50% are due to alcohol abuse. The diagnosis is made when at least two of the following three criteria are met: typical abdominal pain, elevation of serum lipase, and characteristic imaging findings. If those criteria are ambiguous, transabdominal sonography is indicated. The early initiation of food intake lowers the rate of infected pancreatic necrosis, organ failure, or death (odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval [0.2; 0.96]). In AP, Ringer's lactate solution should be preferred for fluid resuscitation, at 200-250 mL/hr for 24 hours. Severe pain should be treated with opiates. The current German clinical practice guideline reflects the developments in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatitis that have taken place over the past few years. The long-term care and monitoring of patients with complication-free pancreatitis is the responsibility of primary care physicians and gastroenterologists.",

        "Abstract": "Immune cell trafficking is a complex and tightly regulated process that is indispensable for the body's fight against pathogens. However, it is also increasingly acknowledged that dysregulation of cell trafficking contributes to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) in gastroenterology and hepatology, such as inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Moreover, altered cell trafficking has also been implicated as a crucial step in the immunopathogenesis of other IMIDs, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Over the past few years, a central role of the gut in mediating these disorders has progressively emerged, and the partly microbiota-driven imprinting of particular cell trafficking phenotypes in the intestine seems to be crucially involved. Therefore, this Review highlights achievements in understanding immune cell trafficking to, within and from the intestine and delineates its consequences for immune-mediated pathology along the gut-liver, gut-joint and gut-brain axes. We also discuss implications for current and future therapeutic approaches that specifically interfere with homing, retention, egress and recirculation of immune cells.",

        "Abstract": "Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) is expressed in several cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as some leukocytes. In intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), JAM-A localizes to cell junctions and plays a role in regulating barrier function. In vitro studies with model cell lines have shown that JAM-A contributes to IEC migration; however, in vivo studies investigating the role of JAM-A in cell migration-dependent processes such as mucosal wound repair have not been performed. In this study, we developed an inducible intestinal epithelial-specific JAM-A-knockdown mouse model (Jam-aERΔIEC). While acute induction of IEC-specific loss of JAM-A did not result in spontaneous colitis, such mice had significantly impaired mucosal healing after chemically induced colitis and after biopsy colonic wounding. In vitro primary cultures of JAM-A-deficient IEC demonstrated impaired migration in wound healing assays. Mechanistic studies revealed that JAM-A stabilizes formation of protein signaling complexes containing Rap1A/Talin/β1 integrin at focal adhesions of migrating IECs. Loss of JAM-A in primary IEC led to decreased Rap1A activity and protein levels of Talin and β1 integrin, and it led to a reduction in focal adhesion structures. These findings suggest that epithelial JAM-A plays a critical role in controlling mucosal repair in vivo through dynamic regulation of focal adhesions.",

        "Abstract": "Nutritional habits of patients with functional dyspepsia can affect the progression of functional dyspepsia. We aimed to determine the foods and dietary habits that may cause symptoms of postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning in functional dyspepsia patients. Sixty functional dyspepsia patients, who were diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria in the endoscopy unit of a gastroenterology institute, were included in the study. Data on the demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, nutritional habits, and food consumption frequency questionnaire of functional dyspepsia patients were collected. Postprandial fullness was found more common in those who preferred roasting as a cooking method. There was no significant difference between symptoms and meal frequency. Epigastric burning and pain were found to be more pronounced in women, and alcohol consumption was less in patients who experienced more epigastric pain. In non-smoker participants, the complaint of early satiety was lower. It was found that broccoli, radish, celery, green olives, and olive oil consumption was less in participants who experienced excessive postprandial fullness. Patients with stomach pain consumed less dry fruits, green olives, butter, alcohol, and fast food. It was found that patients with stomach burning consumed less alcohol and fast food. In conclusion, functional dyspepsia patients should avoid or reduce consuming broccoli, radish, celery, green olives, olive oil, dry fruits, and butter which may trigger symptoms. Reducing consumption of these foods, abandoning unhealthy cooking methods such as roasting, reducing smoking, and reducing consumption of alcohol and fast food might be beneficial for relieving symptoms.",

It is clear that acute abdominal pain may be associated with a number of pathologic conditions. We report an unusual case of an unnoticed swallowed wooden toothpick stuck in the ileocecal area of a young man with right lower abdominal pain who was misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis. However, an abdominal computed tomography scan showed an elongated foreign body stuck in the ileocecal area. The elongated foreign body was identified as a wooden toothpick, which was then grasped with a foreign body forceps and successfully removed through colonoscopy. The patient's abdominal pain was significantly relieved within 2 days following treatment. On the basis of the case report, we suggest the importance of abdominal computed tomography scans for the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain and highlight the need for extra vigilance in excluding the diagnosis of foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with acute abdominal pain.",

        "Abstract": "Cholestasis in infants can indicate a serious hepatobiliary disease and requires timely assessment, diagnosis and intervention to prevent progression to serious liver decompensation. This report aims to highlight recently published studies regarding diagnosis and treatment of cholestasis in infants. The evaluation of neonatal cholestasis can be challenging, requiring the assessment of a broad differential diagnosis in timely fashion. The Italian Society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis is reviewed and compared to other published guidelines. In biliary atresia, the most time-sensitive of these diagnoses, serum matrix metalloproteinase-7 was studied in Japanese infants with biliary atresia with excellent diagnostic performance characteristics. Genetic testing panels are an increasingly used tool to help identify causes of cholestasis. An American experience of genetic testing in large cohort of infants identified a definite or possible genetic diagnosis in 11% of cholestatic infants. In the treatment of prutitus in Alagille syndrome and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis the clinical studies of two newly Food and Drug Administration approved ileal bile acid transport inhibitors are discussed. New information on the prevalence of cytomegalovirus and idiopathic cholestasis as other etiologies of infant cholestasis is also reviewed. Lastly, new insight on potential maternal microbiome regulation on biliary disease in neonates on experimental biliary atresia models is discussed. Cholestasis in infants requires timely diagnosis and intervention. There are exciting new diagnostic and treatment options now being studied which could help minimize the likelihood of advanced liver disease and development of serious complications.",

        "Abstract": "Scarce data have investigated the association between pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We, therefore, aimed to describe the epidemiology and the possible peculiar phenotype and natural history of such an association. Case-control study is based on the Italian Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology (SIGENP) national registry. All children with a combined diagnosis of IBD and EoE were included. The overall prevalence and incidence in 2 periods, 2009 to 2015, and 2016 to 2021, were calculated. Cases were matched with IBD only and EoE only patients in a 1:3:3 ratio. Phenotype and outcomes (courses of steroids, risk of complications, surgery, treatment escalation, and hospitalization) were compared between groups. Eleven patients (age 11.2 ± 2.8 years, Males 91%) with EoE-IBD out of 3090 patients with IBD were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 0.35% and an incidence of 0.18% for 2009 to 2015 and 0.45% for 2016 to 2021. Treatment escalation rates for IBD were significantly higher in patients with IBD compared with EoE-IBD at 12- and 24-month follow-up (0% vs 30%, P = .04; and 9% vs 45.5%, P = .03, respectively). Furthermore, patients with IBD were at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization than both EoE-IBD and EoE patients (log rank P < .001). We found no significant differences in major outcomes related to the EoE course in EoE-IBD patients compared with EoE ones. The incidence and prevalence of EoE in children with IBD are low, although the incidence seems to be rising in recent years. Having EoE appears to be associated with a milder IBD disease course, whereas having IBD does not seem to affect the natural history of EoE. More data are needed to better define the phenotype of such association.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as diagnostic markers, biomarkers of neoplastic progression, and possible therapeutic targets in several immune-mediated diseases. We aimed to analyze the expression profile of selected miRNAs (miR21, miR142, miR223, miR155) in patients with autoimmune atrophic gastritis (AAG), patients with non-autoimmune multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG), and healthy control subjects (HC). A total of 103 patients with AAG were consecutively recruited for this study among those attending our gastroenterology outpatient clinic. Participating patients were divided into two groups: primary, not Helicobacter pylori (HP)-associated related AAG (n=57, P-AAG) and HP-associated AAG (n=46, HP-AAG); this subgroup included HP-positive patients, patients with previously reported HP infection, and patients harboring antral atrophy, considered as a stigma of HP infection. We also included 20 sex-age-matched MAG patients and 10 HC. Upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies were performed on each AAG and MAG patient. Circulating levels of miR21-5p, miR142-3p, miR223-3p, and miR155-5p were measured by RT-PCR in all groups. MiR-21 was over-expressed in P-AAG (p=0.02), HP-AAG (p = 0.04), and MAG (p=0.03) compared with HC. By contrast, miR-142 was more expressed in HC than in HP-AAG (p=0.04) and MAG (p=0.03). MiR-155 showed no significant differences among the four subgroups, while, unexpectedly, miR-223 was overexpressed in HC compared to P-AAG (p=0.01), HP-AAG (p=0.003), and MAG (p<0.001), and was higher in P-AAG than in MAG (p=0.05). MiR-21 was over-expressed in patients with gastric precancerous conditions irrespective of etiology, while in the same subgroups miR-142 and miR-223 were under-expressed compared to healthy controls. Controlling miRNAs up- or downregulation could lead to a breakthrough in treating chronic autoimmune diseases and potentially interfere with the progression to cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The RECK gene is a critical tumor suppressor gene. This study aimed to assess the association between RECK gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the development of HCC in Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis B. In this case-control study, we enrolled patients with CHB from the Gastroenterology Department, Benha University, from June 2016 to February 2018. The RECK gene SNP rs10814325 was identified using real-time PCR allelic discrimination via TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, USA). We enrolled 140 participants in this study. The participants were divided into Group I, which comprised 50 participants with CHB only, Group II, which comprised 50 participants with CHB and HCC, and Group III, which comprised 40 healthy participants. A significantly higher hepatitis B virus DNA viremia level was found in patients with HCC. The predominant RECK genotype was the T/T allele, followed by the T/C allele; however, no significant difference in the distribution of RECK gene SNPs was found between the study groups. No statistically significant difference in RECK gene SNPs was reported among patients with HCC of different Child classes or based on the number, site, size of HCC, and lymph node involvement. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that a serum alpha-fetoprotein level of 92 ng/ml was 96 % sensitive and 100 % specific for the detection of HCC, with an area under the operating characteristic curve of 0.98. RECK gene SNPs have no significant association with the development and characteristics of hepatitis B-related HCC in Egyptian patients.",

        "Abstract": "Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) improves the outcome of experimental necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) by preserving intestinal microcirculation. The feasibility and safety of RIC in preterm infants with NEC are unknown. The study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of RIC in preterm infants with suspected or confirmed NEC. Phase I non-randomised pilot study conducted in three steps: step A to determine the safe duration of limb ischaemia (up to 4 min); step B to assess the safety of 4 repeated cycles of ischaemia-reperfusion at the maximum tolerated duration of ischaemia determined in step A; step C to assess the safety of applying 4 cycles of ischaemia-reperfusion on two consecutive days. Level III neonatal intensive care unit, The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada). Fifteen preterm infants born between 22 and 33 weeks gestational age. Four cycles of ischaemia (varying duration) applied to the limb via a manual sphygmomanometer, followed by reperfusion (4 min) and rest (5 min), repeated on two consecutive days. The primary outcomes were (1) feasibility defined as RIC being performed as planned in the protocol, and (2) safety defined as perfusion returning to baseline within 4 min after cuff deflation. Four cycles/day of limb ischaemia (4 min) followed by reperfusion (4 min) and a 5 min gap, repeated on two consecutive days was feasible and safe in all neonates with suspected or confirmed NEC. This study is pivotal for designing a future randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of RIC in preterm infants with NEC. NCT03860701.",

        "Title": "Esophageal disease and loss to follow-up are common among patients who experience non-endoscopic resolution of food impaction.",
        "Abstract": "Many patients who experience esophageal food impaction (EFI) will have non-endoscopic resolution (NER) of their EFI, but this population is poorly defined. The purpose of this study is to describe the outcomes of patients with NER of EFI. A retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2017 was performed at a single tertiary care center. There were 593 patients who presented to the emergency department with EFI, defined as recent soft food ingestion and inability to tolerate oral secretions. Adequate follow-up was defined as a gastroenterology clinic visit or EGD within 6 months of EFI. Out of these, 149 patients (25.1%) had NER of their EFI. Patients with NER were less likely to have adequate follow-up than those with ER (45.0% vs. 59.5%, P = 0.003). Of those without established esophageal disease and NER, 92.5% had significant esophageal pathology on endoscopy, including stricture (34.0%), features of eosinophilic esophagitis (30.2%), and esophagitis (22.6%). Recurrent EFI occurred at a similar rate between patients with NER and ER (9.4% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.14). Patients with established esophageal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.51, P = 0.04) and recommendation to follow-up at time of EFI (OR: 6.06, P < 0.001) were most likely to follow up after EFI. Approximately, a quarter of patients with EFI will experience NER of their EFI. Virtually, all patients (92.5%) were found to have esophageal disease warranting longitudinal care. Importantly, follow-up rates are significantly lower in those with NER than their counterparts requiring EGD. Our study highlights the need to develop standardized protocols that improve follow-up for patients after NER of EFI.",

        "Abstract": "To determine several clinical and laboratory features as well as the bacterial profile of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in 58 Vietnamese patients admitted to a single center due to liver cirrhosis. We retrospectively analyzed bacteriological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with SBP admitted to the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Center from July 2019 to July 2020. Out of a total 58 SBP patients, 41 (70.9%) had culture-negative neutrocytic ascites. The majority of patients experienced abdominal pain (93,1%) and large ascites (65,5%). Gram-negative bacteria formed the main pathogens (14/17). <i>Escherichia coli</i> (9/17) was the predominant cause followed by <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> (2/17). Antibiotic sensitivity rate of <i>E. coli</i> for third generation cephalosporin was low but high for aminoglycoside and carbapenem antibiotics. The resistance of <i>E. coli</i> was significant against fluoroquinolones (100%). All 3 cases of gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to vancomycin. Our study reported the bacteriological and clinical characteristics of patients with SBP and compared these findings between two groups: positive ascitic fluid culture and negative fluid culture. Ascitic fluid culture can guide for the right antibiotic choice since resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics is common in SBP patients.",

        "Title": "Antifungal prescription practices and consumption in a tertiary care hospital of a developing country.",
        "Abstract": "Antifungal stewardship is a less explored component of antimicrobial stewardship programmes, especially in developing countries. We aimed to determine antifungal prescription practices in a tertiary centre of a developing country to identify the challenges for antifungal stewardship programmes. Four single-day point prevalent surveys were performed in inpatient units and data were collected from medical records. Antifungal use was recorded in terms of consumption, therapeutic strategies and appropriateness. We found a 2.42%-point prevalence of antifungal prescriptions. Antifungal use was higher in children than adults (4.1% vs. 2.03%), medical than surgical units (3.7% vs. 1.24%) and ICUs than general wards (5.8% vs. 1.9%). The highest antifungal use was observed in the haematology-oncology units (29.3%) followed by emergency (16.2%) and gastroenterology units (11.6%). Among 215 prescriptions, amphotericin B was the most commonly prescribed (50.2%) followed by fluconazole (31.6%). The targeted antifungal therapy was practised more commonly (31.5%) than empiric (29.1%), pre-emptive (22.6%) and prophylactic (16.8%) therapy. Amphotericin B was commonly used for pre-emptive (p = .001) and targeted (p = .049) therapy, while fluconazole (p = .001) and voriconazole (p = .011) for prophylaxis. The prescriptions were inappropriate in 25.1% due to the wrong choice of antifungal (44.4%), indication (27.7%) and dosage (24%). The overall mean antifungal consumption was 2.71 DDD/1000 PD and 8.96 DOT/1000 PD. We report here the low prevalence of antifungal use at a tertiary care centre in a developing country. Though training for antifungal use would be important for antifungal stewardship, the challenge would remain with the affordability of antifungals.",

Appropriate management of early nutritional needs is particularly crucial for preterm infants. Although the impact of early nutrition on health outcomes in preterm infants is well established, evidence-based recommendations on complementary feeding for preterm neonates and especially extremely low birth weight and extremely low gestational age neonates are still lacking.

        "Abstract": "To examine the certainty of the evidence supporting health claims about probiotics, yoghurt, kefir, kombucha, fibre and prebiotics, and to assess the quality of online information in Spanish. Content analysis. We compiled a data set of 114 web pages by searching six popular search phrases in Spanish relating to probiotics, yoghurt, kefir, kombucha, fibre and prebiotics on Google.es and coded them for typology and health claims. We examined the certainty of the evidence for health claims from systematic reviews. Information quality was assessed according to 10 criteria, where a web page: mentions scientific publications and reports their conclusions; quantifies relative and absolute effects; acknowledges some limitations; discusses certainty of evidence; reports the potential harms, alternatives and costs; and does not argue based on personal experiences. Gastrointestinal health (86.0%), general health (57.9%), cardiovascular health (53.5%) and immune system health (50.9%) were the most widely mentioned topics. Half of claims (52.6%, 70/133) were supported by evidence from systematic reviews. Probiotics had the highest number of claims supported by evidence and kombucha the lowest. The highest certainty was found for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, necrotising enterocolitis and otitis (moderate) in probiotics and yoghurt, infectious diarrhoea and hepatic encephalopathy (moderate) in prebiotics, and cardiovascular health (high to moderate) and colorectal cancer (moderate) in fibre. On a scale of 0-10, the median information quality score for all web pages was 3. Only 18.4% reported study conclusions, 7.9% quantified the effects, 28.9% acknowledged some limitations in the research and 42.1% reported potential harms. Most online health claims for dietary interventions intended for improving health through the gut microbiome are supported by low or very low certainty of evidence. Online information does not align with the evidence and is incomplete or unbalanced.",

A 51-question mixed-methods survey was developed focusing on personal, professional and financial characteristics. The survey was disseminated via email and fax to practicing gastroenterologists using provincial college registries and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology. Numerical data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted for short answer responses. There were a total of 114 responses (17% response rate) with 35% female respondents. Mean age was 49 years for males and 41 years for females (<i>P =</i> 0.001). Clinical practice types included general GI (63%), urban (82%) and academic (51%). Males reported more endoscopy time (<i>P =</i> 0.001) versus females who spent more time on research (<i>P <</i> 0.001). Men were more likely to be married (<i>P =</i> 0.011), but women were more likely to be responsible for childcare (<i>P =</i> 0.016). Women were more likely to choose between marriage and career and more chose marriage compared to men (<i>P =</i> 0.045). Males earned >$100,000/year higher income than females even when offset by age and work hours (<i>P =</i> 0.048). A salary >$600,000 was reported by 32% of men, compared to 3% of women. Female gastroenterologists reported less mentorship during GI training, challenging relationships with support staff, reduced promotion opportunity, more difficulty publishing and having their competency challenged. Compared to previous data, there has not been significant gender-related progress in the past two decades regarding female gastroenterologists' clinical practices, remuneration and work-life balance.",

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of chronic diseases in patients with IBD. In this case-control study, 280 patients with IBD were compared with 280 healthy individuals, frequency-matched by age, sex, place of residence and marital status. Random sampling was performed in patients that referred to the internal medicine and gastroenterology wards of hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences. Data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire and a checklist for chronic diseases, which were completed through interviews with the case and control groups. Two hundred and twenty-nine (81.78%) patients with IBD had at least one chronic disease. Patients with IBD were at increased risks of rheumatoid arthritis (OR= 4.48, 95%CI: 1.48, 13.54, P= 0.008), eye diseases (OR= 3.49, 95%CI: 1.68, 7.28, P= 0.001), liver diseases (OR= 2.74, 95%CI: 1.40, 5.34, P= 0.003 ), anemia (OR = 2.53, 95%CI: 1.56, 4.13, P= 0.000), depression (OR= 2.43, 95%CI: 1.58, 3.74, P= 0.000), skin diseases (OR= 2.36, 95%CI: 1.18, 4.74, P= 0.015) and hypertension (OR= 1.77, 95%CI: 1.06, 2.95, P= 0.028). The frequency of chronic diseases associated with IBD has been high, therefore, physicians and health care professionals should consider the possibility of other chronic diseases when dealing with IBD patients.",

        "Abstract": "To decrease the percentage of patients undergoing an abdominal radiograph for evaluation of constipation within 24 hours of their initial gastroenterology visit. In January 2015, we implemented a quality improvement, evidence-based guideline (EBG) aimed at standardizing the initial assessment of patients presenting for a new outpatient gastroenterology visit with a primary complaint of constipation. Over the subsequent 5 years, we followed the clinical impact of this guideline initiation with the goal of decreasing unnecessary abdominal radiograph use by 10% within 1 year of EBG launch. Patients older than 6 months and younger than 19 years were included. In total, 6723 patients completed new patient gastroenterology visits for a primary diagnosis of constipation between 2013 and 2019. Of these, 993 (14.8%) patients had abdominal radiographs taken within 24 hours of their initial visit. Over the 7 years of this project, a mean frequency of abdominal radiograph use decreased from 24% to less than 11%. In addition, a 57% decrease in hospital charges related to decreased radiograph use for constipation was found. No increases in subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalization for constipation within 30 days of patients' initial visits were seen. Through local adoption of an EBG, routine use of abdominal radiographs taken during a patient's initial outpatient gastroenterology visit for constipation decreased by more than 50%. This reduction was maintained over a subsequent 5-year period without any detrimental side effects.",

        "Abstract": "Airway manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease are rare in pediatrics. This case describes a nine-year-old female with ulcerative colitis (UC) with progressive stridor and dyspnea for two months. Severe upper airway obstruction was noted on spirometry. CatScan (CT) of the neck and chest revealed tracheal narrowing with circumferential, heterogeneous soft tissue thickening, and posterior wall nodularity. Bronchoscopy visualized the granulation tissue of the large airways and an ulcerative lesion to the right mainstem. Consultation and evaluation by gastroenterology, oncology, and rheumatology determined a diagnosis of extraintestinal manifestations of UC. Systemic steroids led to symptom resolution and improvement in lung function.",

        "Title": "Occult hepatitis B virus infection among patients with chronic liver disease of unidentified cause, Addis Ababa Ethiopia.",
        "Abstract": "Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) characterized by the absence of detectable HBsAg in the presence of HBV DNA in the serum and/or liver tissue remains a potential risk of transmission and diseases progression among different population groups. It could be associated with asymptomatic case up to chronic liver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and characteristics of OBI among patients with CLD of unidentified cause in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study was conducted at the gastroenterology & hepatology referral clinic of three government and two private hospitals in Addis Ababa. Known CLD patients as evidenced by clinical and imaging criteria and/or with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative results using rapid test kit were included. ELISA serological test to anti-HBc Ab, anti HBsAg Ab, and HBsAg were determined using BIORAD kits [ https://www.bio-rad.com ]. HBV-DNA was amplified, and viral loads were determined by quantitative real-time PCR using Abbott m2000rt platform following the manufacturer's instructions. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 20.A total of 48 CLD patients with no identified cause for their liver disease were identified during the study period. All the patients had evidence of CLD by clinical and imaging criteria and nine were excluded. Three (7.69%) of the 39 patients tested positive for HBsAg test done by ELISA making the negative predictive value of the rapid test kits 92.3% compared to ELISA. The remaining 36 patients had serology test for HBV and 16 (44.4%) had positive anti-HBV core antibody. Two (5.56%) of the 36 patients with HBV viral load determination had detectable HBV DNA suggesting presence of an occult hepatitis B infection. Occult hepatitis B infection is found to be an aetiology among CLD patients labelled as having no identified cause by the current standard of care using rapid HBsAg kits in a subset of patients in Ethiopia. This study signifies the high rate of OBI and past evidence of HBV infection among CLD patients and thus nucleic acid testing and/or anti-HBc shall be integrated to the routine health care system to minimize HBV infection risk of transmission and to enhance patient care.",

        "Abstract": "Elevated depressive symptoms are observed in a significant number of youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and have been linked to illness stigma and social isolation. Body image dissatisfaction is an understudied variable in the pediatric IBD literature that may be related to both stigma and social difficulties. It is suspected that, due to the stigmatizing nature of IBD, some youth may feel self-conscious about their body image, which contributes to decreased feelings of social belongingness and ultimately depressive symptoms. The current study tested an illness stigma→ body image dissatisfaction→ thwarted belongingness→ depressive symptoms serial mediation model, in which IBD stigma was hypothesized to indirectly influence youth depressive symptoms through the sequential effects of stigma on body image dissatisfaction and thwarted social belongingness. Youth with IBD (N = 75) between 10 and 18 years old were recruited from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic and completed psychosocial measures. Disease severity was assessed by a physician global assessment. Current medications and BMI data were collected. Analyses revealed significant direct effects among the modeled variables and a significant serial indirect path for illness stigma→ body image dissatisfaction→ thwarted belongingness→ depressive symptoms, controlling for sex, BMI and prednisone medication. Youth who perceive greater IBD stigma are more likely to experience increased body image dissatisfaction due to their IBD, which may engender feelings of social estrangement and ultimately elevated depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms and the psychosocial challenges faced by youth should be routinely monitored as part of comprehensive IBD management.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) represent a category of chronic diseases of gastrointestinal tract with a long-term evolution which includes flares and periods of remission. The aim of the study is to identify and quantify the relationship between IBD status, perceived stress, coping mechanisms, and patients QOL. Cross-sectional study on two samples consisting of 70 IBD patients monitored in the Gastroenterology Department of the Emergency Clinical County Hospital Craiova, Romania, respectively 70 healthy volunteers. Collected data include socio-demographic details, personal and familial medical history, clinical status, presumed risk factors, perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale-PSS), coping strategies (COPE questionnaire) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL-SF-36 scale). Perceived stress was considerably higher on IBD subjects (p<0.0001). The assessment of HRQOL has shown that patients had the best perception over their physical and emotional domains of SF-36 (p<0.0001), while the most often coping mechanisms used are those from the problem-focused category. There is a significant relationship between increased activity of IBD and higher level of stress, that led to the development of problem-focused coping strategies. We did not find a strong correlation between lower HRQOL levels and the items considered as potential risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a limited health resource because of a scarcity of qualified personnel and limited availability of equipment. Non-adherence to endoscopy appointments therefore wastes healthcare resources and may compromise the early detection and treatment of GI diseases. We aimed to identify factors affecting non-attendance at scheduled appointments for GI endoscopy and thus improve GI healthcare outcomes. This was a single-center retrospective cohort study performed at a tertiary hospital gastroenterology endoscopy unit, 12 months before and 12 months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to identify variables associated with non-attendance at scheduled appointments. Overall, 5,938 appointments were analyzed, and the non-attendance rate was 18.3% (1,088). The non-attendance rate fell significantly during the pandemic (22.6% <i>vs</i>. 11.6%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis identified the absence of deep sedation (OR: 3.253, 95% CI [2.386-4.435]; <i>p</i> < 0.001), a referral from a physician other than a gastroenterologist (OR: 1.891, 95% CI [1.630-2.193]; <i>p</i> < 0.001), a longer lead time (OR: 1.006, 95% CI [1.004-1.008]; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and female gender (OR: 1.187, 95% CI [1.033-1.363]; <i>p</i> = 0.015) as associated with appointment non-attendance. Female patients, those undergoing endoscopic procedures without deep sedation, those referred by physicians other than gastroenterologists, and with longer lead time were less likely to adhere to appointments. Precautions should be directed at patients with one or more of these risk factors, and for those scheduled for screening procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

During this admission, the patient developed transaminitis with low platelets prompting suspicion of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, but the concurrent findings of severe hypophosphatemia and rhabdomyolysis were not in favor of HELLP syndrome but that of refeeding syndrome. These clinical entities proved to be a diagnostic dilemma but, ultimately, the patient was managed under refeeding syndrome.

        "Abstract": "The perforation of the bowel as the first presentation of inflammatory bowel disease is a rare occurrence reported in about 0.15-3 % of the literature and is especially unusual in young patients <30 years of age. It is a serious event with most of the perforations occurring on the ileum. This article describes a unique case of a 20-year-old female patient who presented with perforated ileum due to Crohn's disease as an initial presentation operated at a private surgical center. We present a case of a previously asymptomatic 21-year-old female presenting with intestinal perforation secondary to Crohn's disease for the first time. The patient presented with crampy abdominal pain and frequent bilious vomiting of 3 days duration. She also had a high-grade fever and abdominal distension. WBC was 24,000 and an abdominal CT scan showed perforation of the bowel consistent with Crohn's Disease. Ruling out other etiologies perforated viscous secondary to query Crohn's Disease was entertained and laparotomy revealed 2 × 2 cm perforation on the anti-mesenteric border of the terminal ileum. The perforated segment was resected primary anastomosis was performed. Following surgery, the patient was discharged symptom-free and linked to the Gastroenterology unit after a biopsy confirmed Crohn's disease. She was started on Prednisolone and Azathioprine exactly a month after her surgery. Her 6-month follow-up is smooth. Presentation of bowel perforation as an initial feature of Crohn's Disease is a rare phenomenon. Adequate resuscitation followed by emergency laparotomy with primary resection and anastomosis could be life-saving for a hemodynamically stable patient.",

        "Abstract": "There is significant variability in the performance and outcomes of invasive medical procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention, endoscopy, and bronchoscopy. Peer evaluation is a common mechanism for assessment of clinician performance and care quality, and may be ideally suited for the evaluation of medical procedures. We therefore sought to perform a systematic review to identify and characterize peer evaluation tools for practicing clinicians, assess evidence supporting the validity of peer evaluation, and describe best practices of peer evaluation programs across multiple invasive medical procedures. A systematic search of Medline and Embase (through September 7, 2021) was conducted to identify studies of peer evaluation and feedback relating to procedures in the field of internal medicine and related subspecialties. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed. Data were extracted on peer evaluation methods, feedback structures, and the validity and reproducibility of peer evaluations, including inter-observer agreement and associations with other quality measures when available. Of 2,135 retrieved references, 32 studies met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 were from the field of gastroenterology, 5 from cardiology, 3 from pulmonology, and 3 from interventional radiology. Overall, 22 studies described the development or testing of peer scoring systems and 18 reported inter-observer agreement, which was good or excellent in all but 2 studies. Only 4 studies, all from gastroenterology, tested the association of scoring systems with other quality measures, and no studies tested the impact of peer evaluation on patient outcomes. Best practices included standardized scoring systems, prospective criteria for case selection, and collaborative and non-judgmental review. Peer evaluation of invasive medical procedures is feasible and generally demonstrates good or excellent inter-observer agreement when performed with structured tools. Our review identifies common elements of successful interventions across specialties. However, there is limited evidence that peer-evaluated performance is linked to other quality measures or that feedback to clinicians improves patient care or outcomes. Additional research is needed to develop and test peer evaluation and feedback interventions.",

        "Abstract": "The number of artificial intelligence (AI) studies in medicine has exponentially increased recently. However, there is no clear quantification of the clinical benefits of implementing AI-assisted tools in patient care. This study aims to systematically review all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AI-assisted tools to characterize their performance in clinical practice. CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched to identify relevant RCTs published up to July 2021 and comparing the performance of AI-assisted tools with conventional clinical management without AI assistance. We evaluated the primary end points of each study to determine their clinical relevance. This systematic review was conducted following the updated PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Among the 11,839 articles retrieved, only 39 (0.33%) RCTs were included. These RCTs were conducted in an approximately equal distribution from North America, Europe, and Asia. AI-assisted tools were implemented in 13 different clinical specialties. Most RCTs were published in the field of gastroenterology, with 15 studies on AI-assisted endoscopy. Most RCTs studied biosignal-based AI-assisted tools, and a minority of RCTs studied AI-assisted tools drawn from clinical data. In 77% (30/39) of the RCTs, AI-assisted interventions outperformed usual clinical care, and clinically relevant outcomes improved with AI-assisted intervention in 70% (21/30) of the studies. Small sample size and single-center design limited the generalizability of these studies. There is growing evidence supporting the implementation of AI-assisted tools in daily clinical practice; however, the number of available RCTs is limited and heterogeneous. More RCTs of AI-assisted tools integrated into clinical practice are needed to advance the role of AI in medicine.

        "Abstract": "Constipation is a common complaint in the general population. Squatting (using a toilet stool) is associated with faster and more complete bowel emptying, and could therefore help prevent or treat constipation. We analyzed the reviews of online buyers of a toilet stool to assess perceived effectiveness, overall satisfaction and potential side effects. In this exploratory mixed-method study, we collected all plain text reviews left between November 2013 and March 2020 by buyers of a toilet stool on Amazon. We adapted the Framework method to perform a seven-step process to analyze user reviews. We assigned numerical values from -5 (minimum) to +5 (maximum) to perceived effectiveness and overall satisfaction. We included comments left by 10,027 customers who purchased 19 different types of toilet stools (79.1% seven-inch stools, 16.1% folding stools, 4.8% other stools). Perceived effectiveness and overall satisfaction were high (median = 5 and interquartile range = 0 for both variables). Eighty-one individuals reported adverse events related to toilet stool use, mainly musculoskeletal pain (N = 26), numbness in the lower limbs (N = 16), falls (n = 11), constipation (N = 9), anorectal symptom (N = 8), and cramps (N = 6). Perceived effectiveness and overall satisfaction were rated high by those who purchased a toilet stool online. In addition, their use seems to be safe (<1% reported adverse effects). Our results suggest a good risk-benefit ratio. The device may offer an inexpensive option to treat or prevent constipation, and may reduce the frequency of medical visits and the risks associated with long-term use of laxatives.",

        "Abstract": "To evaluate a Chinese-made carbon-13 breath test as a non-invasive diagnostic method for Hp infection in the Peruvian population through the determination of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic utility. A cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out on a secondary database of the Gastroenterology Service of the Cayetano Heredia Hospital and Cayetano Heredia Clinic from November 2017 to August 2018. Patients over 18 years of age who underwent endoscopy were included upper digestive. A sensitivity of 90.3% (95% CI 0.81-0.96), a specificity of 82.5% (95% CI 0.67-0.93), a positive predictive value was found and negative of 90.3% and 82.5%, and positive and negative likelihood ratio of 5.16 and 0.12, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80-0.96). The carbon 13 breath test is a non-invasive and simple test that provides results quickly. However, it is not possible to recommend the routine use of this test due to the discrepancy between the international and local results obtained. Studies with larger sample sizes, standardized protocols and different manufacturers are suggested to evaluate their performance and characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "In the United States, there is poor clinician adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and other guidelines for chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) management. This prospective cohort study evaluated whether a CHB registry improves CHB management. We included patients with CHB aged ≥ 18 years and who had a clinical encounter during September 1, 2016-August 31, 2019. We divided patients into three groups based on care received before September 1, 2019: 1) CIH: primary care clinician at HealthPartners Center for International Health, 2) GI: not CIH and seen by gastroenterology within previous 18 months, and 3) primary care (PC): not CIH and not seen by gastroenterology within previous 18 months. We created and implemented a CHB registry at CIH that allowed staff to identify and perform outreach to patients overdue for CHB management. Patients with laboratory testing (i.e., alanine transaminase and hepatitis B virus DNA) and hepatocellular carcinoma screening in the previous 12 months were considered up to date (UTD). We compared UTD rates between groups at baseline (September 1, 2019) and pilot CHB registry end (February 28, 2020). We evaluated 4,872 patients, 52% of whom were female: 213 CIH, 656 GI, and 4,003 PC. At baseline, GI patients were most UTD (69%) followed by CIH (51%) and PC (11%). At pilot end the percent of UTD patients at CIH increased by 11%, GI decreased by 10%, and PC was unchanged. CHB registry use standardized care and increased the percent of CHB patients with recent laboratory testing and HCC screening.",

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare database during a unique time period, when both the pen and the syringe were available. The pen was proposed to indicate a larger extent of internal control, according to health locus of control. Medication adherence was defined as a medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥ 0.8. A patient was considered nonpersistent if the time between any two dispensing records, minus the days of supply dispensed exceeded 180 days. The predictors of adherence were evaluated using a logistic regression, and the predictors of persistence were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Among the 1083 patients studied, 89% were adherent and 77% were persistent. The patients using the pen and the patients treated in gastroenterology centers were more likely to be adherent and less likely to be nonpersistent. The adherence rate to adalimumab therapy was 89% and the one-year persistence rate was 70%. The pen and treatment in a gastroenterology center had a positive impact on the adherence and persistence among Swedish patients with CD.",

The aim of this study was to probe the benefits of a low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) and a combined exercise program (CEP) on MAFLD by monitoring the clinical process through anthropometric measurement, body mass index (BMI), and specific biomarkers, such as the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). The study was conducted at the National Institute of Gastroenterology, 'S. de Bellis', Italy. Subjects were invited to join the study for 12 months. 54 participants were enrolled. Joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data was applied. Overall, a statistically significant direct effect of LGIMD/CEP adherence on ln (BMI), a statistically significant direct effect of LGIMD/CEP adherence on time-to-event and a strong statistically significant direct effect of log (BMI) on time-to-event were observed. In addition, a statistically significant direct effect of LGIMD/CEP adherence on ln(HOMA-IR), a statistically significant direct effect of LGIMD/CEP adherence on time-to-event and a statistically significant direct effect of ln(HOMA-IR) on time-to-event were observed. LGIMD/CEP significantly improved MAFLD status; in addition, longitudinal BMI and HOMA-IR were good predictors of the disappearance of diagnostic criteria for MAFLD.",

        "Abstract": "Drug-induced pancreatitis (DIP), while not a major cause of acute pancreatitis, remains a debilitating diagnosis resulting in significant patient morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis includes first diagnosing acute pancreatitis, second ruling out more common etiologies (alcohol abuse, gallstones, etc.), and third documenting a thorough history (in particular medications). Essentially, it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Any drugs with the potential to result in acute pancreatitis should be discontinued, and those without future recurrence of pancreatitis are deemed to have had a drug-induced case. Although the exact pathophysiology of the initial development of DIP is unknown, we hypothesize it is different for various drug classes. It is known that once pancreatic enzymes are activated after insult, they activate an inflammatory response resulting in auto-digestion of the pancreas. Our report discusses a previously not documented case of DIP in a patient on hydroxyurea monotherapy for the treatment of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) essential thrombocytosis.",

        "Abstract": "Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a diagnostic technique that enables real-time microscopic imaging during microscopic examination and evaluation of epithelial structures with 1000-fold magnification. CLE can be used in the diagnosis of various pathologies, in pneumology, and in urology, and it is very widely utilized in gastroenterology, most importantly in the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (BE), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), biliary strictures, and cystic pancreatic lesions. A literature search was made in MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar databases while focusing on diagnostics using CLE of BE and EAC. We then examined randomized and observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses relating to the utilization of CLE in BE and EAC diagnostics. Here, we discuss whether CLE can be a suitable diagnostic method for surveillance of BE. Even though many studies have proven that CLE increases diagnostic accuracy in detecting neoplastic transformation of BE, CLE is still not used as a standard diagnostic tool in BE surveillance due to a deficiency of scientific evidence. More studies and data are needed if CLE is to find a place as a new technique in BE surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a prominent psychiatric illness in the United States. It has been found to be higher among patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, few studies have focused on depression among minority populations with inflammatory bowel disease. Our study determined the prevalence of depression in minority patients with inflammatory bowel disease at our safety-net hospital, which serves a predominantly African American patient population. We conducted a single centre retrospective cohort study at a large, urban outpatient centre. We retrieved the electronic medical records of patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were seen in the gastroenterology clinic from December 2018-December 2019. Data on the severity of depression within the minority population, using the nine-question Patient Health Questionnaire, was obtained. The effects of age, sex, inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis, and comorbidities were analysed. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of IBD patients were included in the study, of which 46.7% were female and 53.3% were male. Mean age was 44 years. With regard to race, 88.4% were African American, 5.3% Asian, 2.1% Hispanic, 1.1% American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 3.2% multiracial. A total of 71.6% had Crohn's disease and 28.4% had ulcerative colitis. Overall prevalence of major depressive disorder was 25.3%; 45.8% had minimal, 8.3% mild, 33.3% moderate, and 12.5% severe depression. A total of 34.7% of patients were never screened for depression, and 13.8% had other psychiatric conditions. There was a difference in depression rates based on psychiatric conditions (p = 0.00), but no difference based on sex (p = 0.37), IBD subtype (p = 0.34), or medical conditions (p = 0.84). Rates of depression among minority patients, predominantly African American, with inflammatory bowel disease were higher than previously reported for all patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Over 40% experienced moderate to severe depression. There was a low screening rate for depression. This data will be used to improve depression screening, especially among minorities.",

        "Abstract": "Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) has recently been employed as a novel treatment for gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EUS-GE for GOO at different sites. Consecutive hospitalized patients who underwent EUS-GE for GOO at the Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from March 2017 to April 2020 were recruited in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the obstruction site. The primary outcomes included technical success and clinical success. The secondary outcomes were operation time, post-procedure length of stay (LOS), hospitalization cost, and complications such as peritonitis, bleeding, pneumoperitoneum, abdominal pain, and infection. A total of 51 patients were included. Technical success achieved in 100% patients with proximal GOO and in 88.9% with distal GOO (P = 0.176). Clinical success declined from the oral side to the anal side (P = 0.510). Operation time, hospitalization costs, and post-procedural LOS were similar among groups (P = 0.532, 0.520, and 0.144, respectively). Complications were observed in 28 (54.9%) patients. In approaching the mature phase of the endosopist, clinical success improved, while the secondary outcomes showed no statistically significant difference compared with the initial phase. EUS-GE may be challenging for distal GOO; however, it is safe and effective when carried out by experienced endoscopists. A complete preoperative evaluation to assess the difficulty of the procedure is necessary. Prospective studies with large sample size are needed to further validate our findings.",

        "Abstract": "HLA typing provides essential results for stem cell and solid organ transplants, as well as providing diagnostic benefits for various rheumatology, gastroenterology, neurology, and infectious diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that understanding the expression of patient HLA transcripts can provide additional benefits for many of these same patient groups. Our study cohort was evaluated using a long-read RNA sequencing methodology to provide rapid HLA genotyping results and normalized HLA transcript expression. Our assay used NGSEngine to determine the HLA genotyping result and normalized mRNA transcript expression using Athlon2. The assay demonstrated an excellent concordance rate of 99.7%. Similar to previous studies, for the class I loci, patients demonstrated significantly lower expression of <i>HLA-C</i> than <i>HLA-A</i> and <i>-B</i> (Mann-Whitney U, <i>p</i> value = 0.0065 and <i>p</i> value = 0.0154, respectively). In general, the expression of class II transcripts was lower than that of class I transcripts. This study demonstrates a rapid high-resolution HLA typing assay using RNA-Seq that can provide accurate HLA genotyping and HLA allele-specific transcript expression in 7-8 h, a timeline short enough to perform the assay for deceased donors.",

        "Abstract": "The prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 transmission implies several social distancing mea- sures, imposing a change in the protocols of several hospital departments. Capsule endoscopy protocols changes were implemented and evaluated in a Portuguese tertiary center. The authors compared pre-pandemic and peri-pandemic protocols, the latter favoring social distancing, used in MiroCam (IntroMedic, Seoul, Korea) and PillCam Crohn (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn, USA) capsule endoscopy, in a Gastroenterology Department of a tertiary center. All capsule endoscopy performed in outpatients between February 2018 and September 2020 was included. The authors compared significant lesions detection rate, completeness of procedure, adequate bowel preparation, complications rate, and patient satisfaction (through a brief phone call survey) among the protocols. This study included 70 MiroCam CE and 43 PillCam Crohn capsule endoscopy. No statistically significant differences concern- ing performance measures and patients satisfaction were found among the pre-pandemic protocol and the peri-pandemic protocol in MiroCam capsule endoscopy. Conversely, in PillCam Crohn capsule endoscopy, the rate of complete exams was significantly inferior in the peri-pandemic protocol (84.8% vs 50.0%, P = .036), with no other statistically significant differences in the remaining parameters. The performance measures and patient satisfaction were similar among the protocols analyzed for MiroCam capsule endoscopy. Thus, the readjustment of this capsule endoscopy system, which favors a reduction in hospital stay, appears to be a good alternative to the former protocols in this pandemic era. In contrast, the rate of complete exams was significantly inferior in the adapted protocol to the pandemic era for PillCam Crohn capsule endoscopy, disfavoring its maintenance in the clinical practice.",

She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents. Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 μIU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 μIU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 μg/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 μg/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), β-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries (Figs 1, 2A, 2B). The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand (Fig 3) and pelvis (Fig 3B) were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism. In view of the hypothyroidism, US of neck was also performed (Fig 4). Treatment was started based on the clinical and radiologic parameters, and the child's condition improved with medical treatment.",

        "Title": "Circular Mini-Incision in the Left Iliac Fossa Followed by Purse-String Closure as a Minimally Invasive Approach for the Sigmoid Volvulus: A Technical Note.",
        "Abstract": "Volvulus of the sigmoid is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in Morocco. It is a serious condition with substantial mortality. Initial endoscopic decompression followed by resection of the redundant colon via laparotomy or laparoscopy is the procedure of choice. Exteriorization of the sigmoid colon through a linear skin incision in the left iliac fossa has been described as an alternative approach for the classic midline incision, with or without laparoscopic assistance, with acceptable results. We describe herein a novel, minimally invasive approach for fit patients with non-complicated volvulus sigmoid. This approach consists of a skin-disk incision in the left iliac fossa, exteriorization of the redundant colon, and resection with or without primary anastomosis, followed by a purse-string closure. A 65-year-old patient with no prior notable medical history, presented to the emergency department with his first episode of sigmoid volvulus. A skin-disk incision was made in the left iliac fossa, exteriorization of the sigmoid was done easily through the incision, and resection and manual anastomosis were done. The closure was made in a purse-string fashion. Recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the fourth postoperative day. No wound infection was noted and the cosmetic result was satisfactory. Left iliac skin-disk incision followed by a purse-string closure is an option for approaching the abdomen in the case of sigmoid volvulus. It has been demonstrated that this technique helps reduce wound-related complications in patients undergoing stoma reversal. Authors suggest that cosmetic results are better and the incidence of surgical site infection can be lower with this technique as compared to the classic linear skin incision. Results, however, should be confirmed by larger studies.",

        "Title": "Colonoscopy Quality Assurance and Maintenance of Competency Among Pediatric Gastroenterology Staff Members: A Canadian Center Experience.",
        "Abstract": "Introduction Colonoscopy quality indicators and maintenance of competency skills are relatively well established in the adult literature as compared to the pediatric gastroenterology. One of the suggested quality assurance measures is cecal intubation rate, which is suggested to be >90% in all colonoscopies as per American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines. Terminal ileum (TI) intubations are essentially required for diagnostic reasons in pediatric colonoscopies as compared to the screening reasons in adults. Maintenance of competency in pediatric colonoscopies has been described in the literature but in smaller studies contrary to the adult ones. The aims of this study are to compare our center's individual and group cecal intubation rates and compare it with the published literature, assess the group's terminal ileal intubation rates in comparison with the published literature, assess the most common reasons for failure to intubate the cecum and/or terminal ileum, and to assess whether the presence of a trainee affects the intubation rates and the duration of the procedure. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on all pediatric patients (0-18 years). Colonoscopies performed over a two-year period at our single center were included in the study. Patients scheduled for sigmoidoscopy and with altered anatomy of their colon were excluded from the study. The endoscopy and pathology reports were reviewed to ascertain whether the cecum and TI were reached. Quality of bowel preparation and any other stated reasons for incompletion were obtained. Clinical charts were reviewed to obtain indication for colonoscopy. Skin-to-skin time, which is the time from starting to the finishing of the procedure, was recorded for each procedure. Results A total of 391 colonoscopies were performed during the two-year study period by six gastroenterologists. The number of colonoscopies per staff ranged from 57 to 89 procedures. The overall cecal intubation rate was observed to be 98.5% (range: 95.9%-98.9%). TI intubation rate was lower at a rate of 83.1% (range: 63.3%-92.1%). The main stated reason for the inability to attain cecum/TI was technical difficulty and poor bowel prep. Daytime colonoscopies were shorter (39.5 minutes vs 50.3 minutes) compared to after-hours ones and had a higher TI intubation rate (84.5% vs 62.5%). No complications were encountered in the procedures. Conclusion Despite relatively low volumes, cecal intubation rates are very high, exceeding suggested standards. TI intubation rates were low, and there was noted to be a high degree of variability. However, multicentric collaborative evaluations are required over a longer period of time to establish relevant parameters for quality assurance and competency in pediatric endoscopy.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the practicality and feasibility of EPA (level 4 theory) for establishing medical training and service model in China. We opted for a mixed qualitative and quantitative research method, considering both explanatory and exploratory sequential designs. The qualitative research comprehended focus groups and interviews conducted with two panels of experts. The quantitative research was conducted to collect data about the applicability of international entrustable professional activities (EPAs) pediatrics standards in the Chinese context by organizing a seminar with a sample of 60 pediatricians. A questionnaire was designed with EPAs and distributed within professional networks. Structural equation modeling and statistical analysis were used to process the data. In this study, Medical Service-Groups Model (MSGM) with four levels was successfully established to measure the correlation between specialized and general EPAs. As expected, results showed that specialized EPAs were built on top of general EPAs. There may be a mediating mechanism that general EPAs contribute to the lower level of specialization EPAs. In addition, levels 1 and 2 were primarily needed to lay the groundwork for levels 3 and 4, and these higher levels of EPAs were still the most informative for specialized Gastroenterology EPAs. The diagnosis and treatment level of primary general practitioners, as the basis of the pediatric medical service chain, affected the clinical disposal ability of specialists. The establishment of MSGM provided a theoretical basis for the linkage training of general practitioners and specialist physicians. In future studies, scholars must explore China's EPAs based on unique national conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an invasive endoscopic procedure mainly used for hepatobiliary and pancreatic disorders. Although it was first developed by a surgeon, McCune, there is still debate on who can perform this procedure. This problem, which actually needs to be solved within medical ethics, has been brought to the courts, and lawsuits have been filed against general surgeons to prevent them from performing ERCP. The current situation in our country demonstrates that 50-70% of ERCP procedures are performed by general surgeons. In regions where there are not enough gastroenterology specialists, only general surgeons perform this procedure. Today, general surgeons have hundreds of articles on ERCP procedures and studies accepted as international guideline. ERCP procedure -which is in fact a surgical procedure- is included in hepatobiliary surgical procedures in the general surgery core training schedule. General surgeons receive ERCP education in a 6-month challenging program at centers accredited by the Turkish Surgical Society. The problem of ERCP license cannot be solved by legal authorities but by medical, ethical and deontological discussions. Our recommendation here is that the Ministry of Health should associate this procedure with a specific legislation, just like in endoscopy, and establish a specific ERCP training program accepted for license. In this article, the problem of who should perform ERCP was discussed within the framework of legal legislation, medical doctrine and realities of our country.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence has become an increasingly hot topic in the last several years, and it has also gained its way into the medical field. In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence in the gastroenterology field has been of increasing interest, particularly in the colonoscopy setting. Novel technologies such as deep neural networks have enabled real-time computer-aided polyp detection and diagnosis during colonoscopy. This might lead to increased performance of endoscopists as well as potentially reducing the costs of unnecessary polypectomies of hyperplastic polyps. Newly published prospective trials studying computer-aided detection showed that the assistance of artificial intelligence significantly increased the detection of polyps and non-advanced adenomas approximately by 10%, while three tandem randomized control trials proved that the adenoma miss rate was significantly reduced (e.g., 13.8% vs. 36.7% in one Japanese multicenter trial). Promising results have also been shown in prospective single-arm trials on computer-aided polyp diagnosis, but the evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion.",

        "Abstract": "Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) plays a crucial role in the management of gastroduodenal diseases by allowing a direct and accurate evaluation of the mucosa and the execution of several operative maneuvers. Despite a constant development of new imaging tools and operative devices, the widespread use of EGD has not resulted in a significant reduction of mortality for patients affected by esophageal/gastric cancer during the last three decades in Western countries. Evidence indicates that this disheartening scenario derives from a high variability of execution of EGD which determines its quality and diagnostic yield, delaying the diagnosis of neoplastic diseases. Based on this evidence, in recent years many scientific societies have produced different position papers aimed at defining quality performance measures in EGD. Thus, the Italian Association of Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists, the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy and the Italian Society of Gastroenterology have produced this joint document based on the review of ASGE, ACG, BSG, ESGE and Asian Consensus EGD position papers with the aim of indicating the quality standards of EGD (pre-, intra- and post-procedure) focused on lesion detection to be adopted in the Italian context.",

        "Abstract": "The treatment of sarcoidosis remains uncertain, despite 70 years of study. The conventional approach is to initiate corticosteroids in individuals who require treatment. The position of more aggressive regimes is unknown. Recent recognition that many patients will require prolonged therapy, and the observation that corticosteroids lead to overt and insidious toxicities, have led to suggestions that steroid-sparing medications be used earlier in the management of sarcoidosis. Individuals with poor prognostic features, designated as 'high-risk' sarcoidosis may, especially benefit from a broader palette of therapeutic options in the initial treatment regimen. An even more aggressive approach, known as 'top-down' or 'hit-hard and early' therapy has emerged in the fields of gastroenterology and rheumatology in the past 15 years, on the premise that highly effective early control of inflammation leads to better outcomes. These regimens typically involve early initiation of biologic therapies. For certain subpopulations of sarcoidosis patients, 'top-down' therapy could be helpful. Severe pulmonary sarcoidosis, neurosarcoidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis and multiorgan sarcoidosis are phenotypes that may be most relevant for revised therapeutic algorithms. Precision medicine approaches and randomized trials will be necessary to confirm a role for top-down therapy in the routine management of sarcoidosis.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain in association with more frequent, loose stools. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) includes disordered gut motility, alterations in gut microbiota, neural-hormonal system abnormalities, immune reactivity, and visceral hypersensitivity. Timely diagnosis of IBS-D can be achieved easily using clinical criteria. Formal IBS diagnosis is important for optimizing treatment and patient outcomes and facilitating patient access to appropriate educational resources. Yet, given the symptom overlap with other gastrointestinal conditions, diagnosis of IBS-D often is perceived to be challenging. Treatment of IBS includes both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options. Rifaximin, alosetron, and eluxadoline are effective treatments indicated for IBS-D, but have limited availability internationally. Dietary approaches may also be indicated for certain patients with IBS-D. Psychological interventions may be effective in treating abdominal pain alone and global symptoms in IBS. We describe use of these diverse therapies and provide an overview to facilitate the primary care provider's approach to distinguishing IBS-D from other conditions with symptom overlap.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the value of new gastric cancer screening score system for risk assessment of gastric precancerous lesions.<b>Methods:</b> A total of 520 patients were enrolled after the examination of endoscopy at Endoscopy Center, Department of Gastroenterology, from June 2018 to December 2021. The patients were divided into three groups according to age, gender, serum helicobacter pylori antibody test, pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), pepsinogen I/II ratio (PGR) and gastrin-17 test results before endoscopy: Group A defined as low-risk group (0-11 points), Group B defined as middle-risk group (12-16 points), Group C defined as high-risk group (17-23 points). The detection rates of gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis in three groups were analyzed. According to the range and degree of atrophy/intestinal metaplasia, patients were divided into five groups on the basis of OLGA/OLGIM staging system. The levels of PG I, PG II and PGR were compared between different groups, and the correlation between new gastric cancer screening score system and OLGA/OLGIM staging system were evaluated. Statistical analysis was accomplished by ANOVA, chi-square test and Gamma coefficient analysis.<b>Results:</b> A total of 520 patients were enrolled. 268 patients were classified into group A,222 patients into group B and 30 patients into group C, respectively. According to the pathological results, 281 cases were non-atrophic gastritis, 230 cases atrophic gastritis and 9 cases gastric cancer. For OLGA staging system, 281 patients were divided into stage-0 group, 121 patients into stage-I group, 72 patients into stage-II group, 33 patients into stage-III group and 13 patients into stage-IV groups. The PGI and PGR level correlated inversely with the rising OLGA stages (<i>F</i> = 3.028, <i>p </i>= .016, <i>F</i> = 6.036, <i>p</i> < .001). For OLGIM staging system, 252 patients were divided into stage-0 group, 137 patients into stage-I group, 80 patients into stage-II group, 36 patients into stage-III group and 15 patients into stage-IV group. The PGR level correlated inversely with the rising OLGIM stages (<i>F</i> = 3.466, <i>p</i>＝.007). The detection rates of gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis in Group C were much higher than other groups. (<i>X<sup>2</sup></i> = 14.727, <i>p</i> < .001; <i>X<sup>2</sup></i> = 51.280, <i>p</i> < .001). Gamma coefficient analysis showed significant correlations between OLGA/OLGIM and the new gastric cancer screening score system (<i>p</i> < .001).<b>Conclusions:</b> The new gastric cancer screening score system is closely linked with histological OLGA/OLGIM staging system in the risk assessment of gastric precancerous lesions.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of and the factors associated with the occurrence of bleeding in CLD patients who underwent dental surgical procedures. This was a retrospective study whose data were collected in a hospital dentistry service between 2010 and 2016. The patients were referred from the gastroenterology and liver transplantation services of a university hospital for dental treatment. The study followed the STROBE guidelines. Among the 71 surgical procedures performed, there were 17 (24%) perioperative and postoperative bleeding episodes, 14 of which were in pretransplant patients and 11 received blood transfusion before dental surgery. Individuals with a previous history of bleeding (PR = 2.67, CI = 1.07-6.67, P  = 0.035) and those with a platelet count before surgery 50 × 10 9 /l or less (PR = 7.48, CI = 1.70-32.86, P  = 0.008) had a higher prevalence of perioperative and postoperative bleeding episodes than their peers without a previous history of bleeding, and those with platelet count greater than 50 × 10 9 /l. The approach to individuals with CLD is complex and represents a challenge to the clinician. A careful anamnesis combined with laboratory screening of coagulation disorders appears to be useful to identify individuals at a major risk of bleeding. Studies identifying the predisposing factors of bleeding in CLD patients support well tolerated protocols for oral surgery in this group.",

We systematically review autonomic dysfunction due to VZV infection. This study followed the PRISMA guideline, and three databases were researched and included cross-sectional studies in full-length publications in the English language using appropriate search keywords. A total of 102 articles were identified initially; finally 45 studies were used for review, comprising pupillomotor dysfunction in 4, sudomotor dysfunction in 2, cardiovascular dysfunction in 2, gastrointestinal dysfunction in 14, and urogenital dysfunction in 23. They can be summarized as (1) VZV infection rarely produces orthostatic hypotension, which involves diffuse sympathetic dysfunction by polyneuropathy. (2) In contrast, VZV infection produces dysfunction of the bladder and the bowel, which involves segmental parasympathetic or sympathetic dysfunction by dorsal root ganglionopathy. Awareness of VZV-related autonomic dysfunction is important, because such patients may first visit a gastroenterology or urology clinic. Close collaboration among neurologists, dermatologists, gastroenterologists, and urologists is important to start early antiviral agents and maximize bowel and bladder care in such patients.",

        "Abstract": "Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are immune-mediated diseases triggered by the consumption of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. These guidelines were developed to provide general practitioners, paediatricians, gastroenterologists, and other clinicians with an overview on the diagnosis, management and follow-up of coeliac patients and those with dermatitis herpetiformis. Guidelines were developed by the Italian Societies of Gastroenterology. Following a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Statements and recommendations were developed by working groups consisting of gastroenterologists and a paediatrician with expertise in this field. These guidelines provide a practical guidance for the diagnosis, management and follow-up of coeliac patients and dermatitis herpetiformis in children and adults, both in primary care and in specialist settings. We developed four sections on diagnosis, gluten-free diet, follow-up and risk of complications in adults, one section focused on diagnosis and follow-up in children and one on the diagnosis and management of dermatitis herpetiformis. These guidelines may support clinicians to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with coeliac disease.",

        "Abstract": "Area postrema syndrome (APS) as the isolated manifestation in autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy has been rarely reported. A 61-year-old male patient presented with intractable hiccup. He was first admitted to the department of Gastroenterology because he had no symptoms other than hiccup. Then he was diagnosed with possible digestive system disease and started on treatment. 2 weeks later, his symptom didn't improve at all. After consultation, the patient was referred to our department. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed lymphocytes pleocytosis, elevated protein level. Cell-based assays demonstrated GFAP antibodies in blood and CSF. His symptom improved with steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 g for 5 days), followed by a gradual tapering of oral prednisolone. Three months after the initial presentation, he showed no relapses. We report atypical manifestation of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy which presented as APS, suggesting that autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy should be added to the list of possible cause of APS.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and women in the United States. Small polyps are slow to grow and turn to cancer, which provides time for screening and removal of the precancerous polyps so that colorectal cancer is prevented. Quality colonoscopy services are essential to ensure all polyps are found and removed as the final step of colorectal cancer screening. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Quality Assurance in Endoscopy Committee developed quality indicators for colonoscopy services. The Committee prioritized 3 quality indicators for screening colonoscopies: the frequency of (1) adenoma detection in asymptomatic patients at average risk; (2) adherence to the surveillance intervals for postpolypectomy, postcancer resection, or the 10-year interval for the average-risk patients with good bowel preparations who had negative colonoscopies; and (3) visualization of the cecum by notation and landmark photographic documentation. Gastroenterology nurses, endoscopists, and the quality management team can use the Plan-Do-Study-Act method of quality improvement to meet the established performance targets and prevent interval cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Transition from originator biological medicines to their biosimilar equivalents is now part of routine clinical practice, but there is little understanding of patient experiences, which influence adherence and overall satisfaction with care. Understanding this will help ensure future switches adequately address patients' concerns and expectations leading to better outcomes for all stakeholders. 35 patients participating in a clinical trial including an open-label transition event from originator to biosimilar adalimumab, mimicking what would be encountered in a real-world setting, took part in semi-structured interviews exploring their experience of biosimilar transition. Opinions expressed were often heterogeneous, but common experiences and themes were identified. Five themes were identified following thematic analysis. (1) Understanding and awareness of biosimilars: prior awareness of biosimilars and knowledge of the biosimilar concept was low, indicating a disparity between healthcare professionals and patients. (2) Motivation to undertake transition: patients accept a biosimilar transition to minimise drug expenditure. (3) Initial concerns: before undertaking biosimilar transition away from the brand they had experienced, anticipated loss of efficacy and adverse effects from the biosimilar were common concerns for patients. (4) Reassuring factors: trust in the healthcare team is critical to patient acceptance of biosimilars. Important reassurances include a point of contact, education about biosimilars and monitoring. (5) Experiences during the transition: on reflection, participants described consistent efficacy and tolerability (although 22 participants specifically mentioned injection pain) following brand transition. The majority of patients felt comfortable with future transition to another adalimumab biosimilar. Injection experience was an important component of patient satisfaction.",

Recently, the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to gastroenterology has been the focus of great interest. Our aim was to develop an AI model for the automatic detection of protruding lesions in DAE images. A deep learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network was designed. Each frame was evaluated for the presence of enteric protruding lesions. The area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were used to assess the performance of the convolutional neural network. A total of 7,925 images from 72 patients were included. Our model had a sensitivity and specificity of 97.0% and 97.4%, respectively. The area under the curve was 1.00. Our model was able to efficiently detect enteric protruding lesions. The development of AI tools may enhance the diagnostic capacity of deep enteroscopy techniques.",

        "Abstract": "No recommendation regarding antibiotic prophylaxis and preparation modalities are available for patients with esophageal motor disorders who benefit from Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM). The aim of our study was to evaluate their impact on the POEM's safety. This study was a comparative and multicentric retrospective analysis of a database prospectively collected. Patients over 18 years old with esophageal motor disorders confirmed by prior manometry, who underwent POEM were included. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of adverse events, as classified by Cotton, based on whether or not antibiotic prophylaxis was administered. A total of 226 patients (median age 52.9 ± 19.12 years [18-105], 116 women [51.3%]) were included. The indication for POEM was mainly type 2 achalasia (<i>n</i> = 135, 60.3%). Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to 170 patients (75.2%) during 3.93 ± 3.46 days [1-21]. The overall adverse events rate was 9.3% (<i>n</i> = 21). Antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with the occurrence of adverse events (<i>p</i> = .003), but had no impact on their severity (<i>p</i> = .238). Antibiotic prophylaxis didn't influence the effectiveness of POEM (1 [0-4] vs 1 [0-9], <i>p</i> = .231). The use of a liquid diet in the 48 h prior to the procedure was significantly associated with a lower adverse events rate (3.1% vs 6.19%, <i>p</i> = .0002). The antibiotic prophylaxis during POEM does not prevent adverse events, had no impact on their severity and the efficacy of the procedure. A liquid diet before the procedure should be systematically proposed.",

        "Abstract": "In April 2022, an increased incidence of acute hepatitis cases of unknown etiology among previously healthy children across the United Kingdom was described. Since, more than 270 cases from the United Kingdom and hundreds more from all across the world have been reported. The majority of affected children were younger than 6 years of age. The clinical presentation was nonspecific with diarrhea and vomiting usually preceding the appearance of jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, and malaise. Approximately 5% have required liver transplantation. An infectious etiology has been considered likely given the epidemiological and clinical features of the reported cases. Between 50 and 60% of the children tested were diagnosed with adenovirus infection although a clear etiological connection has still to be demonstrated. No link with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine was found. What is not clear to date is whether the high number of acute hepatitis cases reported is related to a true increase in incidence or heightened awareness following on from the initial reports from the United Kingdom. The Hepatology Committee of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) developed a paper on the current outbreak of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology recognizing its importance and the need of approaching the current situation with a scientifically rigorous approach. The aims of the article are to summarize the current knowledge and to identify the most pertinent issues regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition and the research questions raised.",

        "Abstract": "and importance: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is common in the clinic. In combination with haemorrhagic shock, morbidity is high. Rapid diagnosis and treatment can save lives. With the introduction of precision imaging several treatment options are feasible. Up-to-date diagnosis and treatment requires expertise from interventional radiology, gastroenterology and surgery to form a dedicated intervention team. This is illustrated by a typical case. We report a 78-year-old otherwise healthy male with a severe diverticulum bleeding. He was initially diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Approximately 60 minutes after CT scanning, he became haemodynamically instable. He also vomited coffee-like fluid but no clear blood or clots. A repeated CT scan showed active bleeding in the retroperitoneal space highly suspicious for a diverticular bleeding just outside the lumen of the duodenum. An acute multidisciplinary intervention team immediately decided not to perform endoscopy (according to the upper GI bleeding guidelines) but to extend the imaging procedure with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). By this time, active bleeding from a side branch of the gastroduodenal artery was noted and successfully coiled. Guidelines determine day-to-day management in clinical medicine. Still, there is an exception to every rule. The case presented here was typical of upper GI bleeding with haemodynamic instability and signs of shock, but without haematemesis. This combination indicated a bleeding from somewhere outside the lumen of the GI tract. Instead of endoscopy, the acute intervention team decided to perform CT angiography (CTa) with subsequent DSA. On imaging, the bleeding focus was immediately identified and treated by coiling. Performance of CTa immediately followed by DSA and no endoscopy was decided by an acute intervention team in a patient with upper GI bleeding and haemorrhagic shock. Swift coiling of the bleeding artery outside the GI tract lumen was successful. The team in charge relied on a hybrid multifunctional unit fully equipped to perform interventional radiologic as well as GI procedures.",

A retrospective review of clinical data reviewed pregnancy outcomes and inflammatory disease activity in 18 pregnancies where the mother was using a biosimilar TNFi at conception. Biosimilar therapy was not associated with congenital abnormalities, preterm birth or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Stopping biosimilar TNFi in pregnancy was associated with childbirth at an earlier gestation, as well as a flare of inflammatory disease in pregnancy or post-partum. Women and clinicians should feel confident in using biosimilar TNFi in early pregnancy, and continuing them through pregnancy to prevent flares in late pregnancy or the early post-partum.",

The clinical presentation is highly variable, and it often mimics other more common causes of abdominal pain. In most patients, imaging studies such as doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging are adequate for diagnosis. Occasionally imaging studies may be inadequate, and the diagnosis may not be made until complications such as bowel necrosis and perforation have occurred. We present a case of a morbidly obese 45-year-old female who was initially treated for suspected small bowel enteritis and discharged home on several occasions after nonspecific findings on abdominal imaging were seen and interval improvement in symptoms occurred with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. She then presented with worsening symptoms and was found on abdominal imaging to have a large fluid collection in the peritoneal cavity requiring exploratory laparotomy with peritoneal washout and partial small bowel resection due to perforation. She was diagnosed with PVT with mesenteric extension after samples of the resected mesentery were evaluated in the pathology laboratory. Her treatment included a prolonged course of antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition, and anticoagulation.",

        "Title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update: Diagnosis and Management of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Lean Individuals: Expert Review.",
        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is well recognized as a leading etiology for chronic liver disease, affecting >25% of the US and global populations. Up to 1 in 4 individuals with NAFLD have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although NAFLD is observed predominantly in persons with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, an estimated 7%-20% of individuals with NAFLD have lean body habitus. Limited guidance is available to clinicians on appropriate clinical evaluation in lean individuals with NAFLD, such as for inherited/genetic disorders, lipodystrophy, drug-induced NAFLD, and inflammatory disorders. Emerging data now provide more robust evidence to define the epidemiology, natural history, prognosis, and mortality of lean individuals with NAFLD. Multiple studies have found that NAFLD among lean individuals is associated with increased cardiovascular, liver, and all-cause mortality relative to those without NAFLD. This American Gastroenterological Association Clinical Practice Update provides Best Practice Advice to assist clinicians in evidence-based approaches to the diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD in lean individuals. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Lean NAFLD should be diagnosed in individuals with NAFLD and body mass index <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (non-Asian race) or body mass index <23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (Asian race). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Lean individuals with NAFLD should be evaluated routinely for comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Lean individuals with NAFLD should be risk stratified for hepatic fibrosis to identify those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Lean individuals in the general population should not undergo routine screening for NAFLD; however, screening should be considered for individuals older than 40 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: NAFLD should be considered in lean individuals with metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), elevated liver biochemical tests, or incidentally noted hepatic steatosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Clinicians should query patients routinely regarding alcohol consumption patterns in all patients with lean NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: In patients with lean NAFLD, other causes of liver disease should be ruled out, including other causes of fatty liver, such as HIV, lipodystrophy, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, and medication-induced hepatic steatosis (methotrexate, amiodarone, tamoxifen, and steroids). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Current evidence is inadequate to support routine testing for genetic variants in patients with lean NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Liver biopsy, as the reference standard, should be considered if there is uncertainty regarding contributing causes of liver injury and/or the stage of liver fibrosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Serum indices (NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibrosis-4 score) and imaging techniques (transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography) may be used as alternatives to liver biopsy for fibrosis staging and patient follow-up. These tests can be performed at the time of diagnosis and repeated at intervals of 6 months to 2 years, depending on fibrosis stage and the patient's response to intervention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: If noninvasive tests (eg, Fibrosis-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score) are indeterminate, a second noninvasive test (eg, transient elastography or magnetic resonance elastography) should be performed to confirm the stage and prognosis of NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In lean patients with NAFLD, lifestyle intervention, including exercise, diet modification, and avoidance of fructose- and sugar-sweetened drinks, to target a modest weight loss of 3%-5% is suggested. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Administration of vitamin E may be considered in lean persons with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but without type 2 diabetes mellitus or cirrhosis. Oral pioglitazone 30 mg daily may be considered in lean persons with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis without cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: The therapeutic role of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in the management of lean NAFLD is not fully defined and requires further investigation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance with abdominal ultrasound with or without serum α-fetoprotein twice per year is suggested in patients with lean NAFLD and clinical markers compatible with liver cirrhosis.",

        "Abstract": "Compliance in outpatients with gastrointestinal (GI) malabsorption is key in nutritional treatment. The objective of this study was to assess compliance in patients with GI impairment and malnutrition taking a high-calorie, high-protein, peptide-based oral nutritional supplement (ONS-PBD). A prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted in 19 medical sites in Spain where ONS-PBD were prescribed as standard of care. Patients consumed ONS-PBD daily for 12 wk. Compliance was calculated as the percentage consumed of the prescribed amount of ONS per day. A total of 90 adult patients were included in the study, of whom 64 completed the 12-wk regimine. Mean compliance was 78.8% ± 24.5%. Risk of malnutrition decreased in 56.3% of patients at 12 wk, as measured with the malnutrition universal screening tool. A reduction in abdominal pain was observed and stool consistency improved, with a mean of 54.7% and 27.5%, respectively. Improvements in quality of life and a decrease in percentage of patients with severe functional impairment were observed. These data show that ONS-PBD compliance in malnourished patients with GI symptoms is high, reducing GI symptoms and improving patients' nutritional status.",

        "Abstract": "Esophageal strictures are well-known to the pediatric gastroenterology and surgery communities. Such strictures can arise from congenital malformations, inflammatory disorders, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), or even caustic substance ingestion. Rarely, in the instances of caustic ingestion, GERD, or inflammatory disorders, total obliteration of the esophageal lumen has been described. In those instances, as well as in those with high-grade stenosis refractory to dilations, esophageal reconstruction is the procedure of choice. However, in a small subset of adults with short-segment total esophageal obliteration after radiotherapy, an endoscopic rendezvous procedure has been described. Here we present a case of a 2-year-old female with total esophageal luminal obliteration with successful recanalization using an endoscopic rendezvous procedure. This case presents a unique approach to esophageal recanalization using a minimally invasive technique, only documented in the adult literature.",

        "Title": "Distinct histopathological phenotypes of severe alcoholic hepatitis suggest different mechanisms driving liver injury and failure.",
        "Abstract": "Intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration has been implicated in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) pathogenesis; however, the mechanism underlying neutrophil-induced injury in SAH remains obscure. This translational study aims to describe the patterns of intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration and its involvement in SAH pathogenesis. Immunohistochemistry analyses of explanted livers identified two SAH phenotypes despite a similar clinical presentation, one with high intrahepatic neutrophils (Neuhi), but low levels of CD8+ T cells, and vice versa. RNA-Seq analyses demonstrated that neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1), a key factor in controlling neutrophilic ROS production, was upregulated and correlated with hepatic inflammation and disease progression. To study specifically the mechanisms related to Neuhi in AH patients and liver injury, we used the mouse model of chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and found that myeloid-specific deletion of the Ncf1 gene abolished ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation and steatosis. RNA-Seq analysis and the data from experimental models revealed that neutrophilic NCF1-dependent ROS promoted alcoholic hepatitis (AH) by inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (a key regulator of lipid metabolism) and microRNA-223 (a key antiinflammatory and antifibrotic microRNA). In conclusion, two distinct histopathological phenotypes based on liver immune phenotyping are observed in SAH patients, suggesting a separate mechanism driving liver injury and/or failure in these patients.",

        "Abstract": "The WHO Regional Office for Europe and the Federation of International Societies for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition held a joint workshop, \"Moving Complementary Feeding Forward\" at the sixth World Congress Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in 2021. Here we summarize workshop presentations and discussions. The workshop covered health implications of complementary feeding (CF) including allergies, challenges to meet dietary needs during the CF period, quality of commercial complementary foods (CFD) and respective marketing practices, national CF guidelines in Europe, a nutrient profiling system for CFD, and global policy perspectives on the standards and regulation of marketing for CFD. Adequate CF practices are of critical importance for short and long-term child health, prevention of nutrient deficiencies, normal growth and development, and reducing the risk of allergies. The workshop identified the need to improve feeding practices, harmonize evidence-based information and develop guidance jointly with various stakeholders, improve the composition and marketing practices of commercial CFD and their transparent labeling based on nutrient profiling. Renewed efforts for collaboration between scientists, public health experts, pediatric associations, national governments, and the WHO are necessary for advancing progress.",

Of 270 participants, 219 were selected for data analysis. The mean age ( SD ) of the participants was 41.18 (15.22), with a median of 41 years and a slightly higher percentage (58.4%) of females in comparison with males (41.6%). The bowel preparation quality of the control and intervention groups in the two centers was based on the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale scores and there was a significant difference ( p < .001) of M ± SD between the control (5.79 ± 1.123) and experimental (7.52 ± 1.225) groups. Findings suggest a personalized educational program is having a significant impact on increasing the quality of bowel preparation.",

        "Abstract": "There are about 10-23% of adults worldwide suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Over the past few decades, there are many aspects of uncertainty regarding IBS leading to an ongoing interest in the topic as reflected by a vast number of publications, whose heterogeneity and variable quality may challenge researchers to measure their scientific impact, to identify collaborative networks, and to grasp actively researched themes. Accordingly, with help from bibliometric approaches, our goal is to assess the structure, evolution, and trends of IBS research between 2007 and 2022. The documents exclusively focusing on IBS from 2007 to 2022 were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection. The annual productivity of IBS research, and the most prolific countries or regions, authors, journals and resource-, intellectual- and knowledge-sharing in IBS research, as well as co-citation analysis of references and keywords were analyzed through Microsoft Office Excel 2019, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer. In total, 4,092 publications were reviewed. The USA led the list of countries with the most publications (1,226, 29.96%). Mayo Clinic contributed more publications than any other institution (193, 4.71%). MAGNUS SIMREN stood out as the most active and impactful scholar with the highest number of publications and the greatest betweenness centrality value. The most high-yield journal in this field was <i>Neurogastroenterology and motility: the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society</i> (275, 6.72%). <i>Gastroenterology</i> had the most co-citations (3,721, 3.60%). Keywords with the ongoing strong citation bursts were chromogranin A, rat model, peptide YY, gut microbiota, and low-FODMAP diet, etc. Through bibliometric analysis, we gleaned deep insight into the current status of literature investigating IBS for the first time. These findings will be useful to scholars interested in understanding the key information in the field, as well as identifying possible research frontiers.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in medical therapies and liver transplantation have resulted in a greater number of pediatric patients reaching young adulthood. However, there is an increased risk for medical complications and morbidity surrounding transfer from pediatric to adult hepatology and transplant services. Health care transition (HCT) is the process of moving from a child/family-centered model of care to an adult or patient-centered model of health care. Successful HCT requires a partnership between pediatric and adult providers across all disciplines resulting in a transition process that does not end at the time of transfer but continues throughout early adulthood. Joint consensus guidelines in collaboration with the American Society of Transplantation are presented to facilitate the adoption of a structured, multidisciplinary approach to transition planning utilizing The Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition TM for use by both pediatric and adult specialists. This paper provides guidance and seeks support for the implementation of an HCT program which spans across both pediatric and adult hepatology and transplant centers.",

        "Abstract": "Early diagnosis of functional constipation is important for reducing its negative consequences on the health of children and adolescents. To describe the clinical spectrum of functional constipation and bowel habit patterns in schoolchildren recruited from two primary schools and patients from a pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic. This cross-sectional study included 452 students from two elementary schools in the city of Osasco and 81 patients with functional constipation seen in an outpatient clinic specializing in pediatric gastroenterology. All children were aged between 6 and 12 years. The Rome IV criteria (two features for more than 1 month) and the Bristol scale were used. The prevalence of functional constipation among the elementary school students was 22.3% (n=101). Among the 351 students who did not have functional constipation, 182 (51.9%) had one of the clinical manifestations of the Rome IV criteria. Bristol stool scale types 1 and 2 were observed in 14 (8.3%) of the 169 students without any clinical manifestation of the Rome IV criteria and in 28 (15.4%) of the 182 students who presented one of the Rome IV criteria for functional constipation (P=0.060). A comparison of the clinical manifestations of children with functional constipation identified at school in relation to those seen at the specialized clinic showed the following differences: fewer than two bowel movements per week (21.8% and 54.3%; P<0.001, respectively), one or more episodes of fecal incontinence per week (14.8% and 53.1%; P<0.001), and retentive posturing (70.3% and 40.7%, P<0.001). Only 18 (17.8%) of the 101 students identified at the schools with functional constipation had received any treatment for this disease in the previous 2 months. As expected, the frequency of more severe clinical manifestations was higher in children seen at specialized clinics. Only a small proportion of the children identified with functional constipation at primary schools had undergone any form of treatment in the previous 2 months. More than half of the children without functional constipation in elementary schools reported one of the Rome IV clinical manifestations. Finally, functional constipation has a broad clinical spectrum and also requires attention for the prevention and the management of its early clinical manifestations.",

A descriptive retrospective bicentric study, between January 2007 and December 2016, including patients with LG-MALT treated in the gastroenterology departments of Sahloul hospital in Sousse and Habib Bougtafa hospital in Bizerte, and having received treatment for eradication of HP. Sixty-three patients were included. The male/female sex ratio was 1.42. The average age was 58 years. The symptomatology was dominated by epigastric pain (96.8%). On digestive endoscopy, the most frequent location and appearance were gastric antrum (39.6%) and ulcerations (89%). The lymphoma was classified as stage IE and IIE1 in 81% and 19% of cases, respectively. The HP status was positive in all patients. The HP eradication rate was 82.5% after three anti-HP treatment courses. Complete remission of lymphoma was obtained in 81% of patients at 18 months. Non-response to HP eradication therapy was observed in 19% of patients. Non-responder patients had a longer diagnostic delay (p=0.02), more diffuse endoscopic involvement (p=0.001) and a more frequent appearance of large gastric folds (p=0.001). The course of LG-MALT is determined by the treatment for the eradication of HP. Its success promotes remission of lymphoma.",

        "Abstract": "Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) has a high sensitivity for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). In a symptomatic population FIT may identify those patients who require colorectal investigation with the highest priority. FIT offers considerable advantages over the use of symptoms alone, as an objective measure of risk with a vastly superior positive predictive value for CRC, while conversely identifying a truly low risk cohort of patients. The aim of this guideline was to provide a clear strategy for the use of FIT in the diagnostic pathway of people with signs or symptoms of a suspected diagnosis of CRC. The guideline was jointly developed by the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland/British Society of Gastroenterology, specifically by a 21-member multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG). A systematic review of 13 535 publications was undertaken to develop 23 evidence and expert opinion-based recommendations for the triage of people with symptoms of a suspected CRC diagnosis in primary care. In order to achieve consensus among a broad group of key stakeholders, we completed an extended Delphi of the GDG, and also 61 other individuals across the UK and Ireland, including by members of the public, charities and primary and secondary care. Seventeen research recommendations were also prioritised to inform clinical management.",

This occurs due to erosion of the pancreatic or peripancreatic artery by the pancreatic enzyme-rich pancreatic secretion pseudocyst. If left untreated, it may cause massive and even fatal haemorrhage. Interventional radiology with coil embolisation of the pseudoaneurysm is the standard of care in such cases. We describe a patient who developed a pseudoaneurysm involving the origin of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). This was successfully managed by coil embolisation of the pseudoaneurysm along with placement of a flow diverter-like stent in the common hepatic artery across the origin of the GDA leading to exclusion of the diseased segment.",

        "Abstract": "A man in his 80s who had a history of diabetes mellitus and aortic valve replacement was referred to our hospital for treatment of early gastric cancer and underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Three days after ESD, the patient presented with low back pain and fever (38.7°). We initially considered adverse events associated with gastric ESD such as delayed perforation. Moreover, thromboembolism and infectious endocarditis were suspected because of his medical history. However, there were no remarkable findings suggestive of these diseases. Finally, based on the results of blood cultures and MRI, the diagnosis of pyogenic spondylitis (PS) was made. We administered antibiotics for 12 weeks, and the patient improved without neurological impairments. This case indicates that bacteraemia and subsequent PS can occur following gastric ESD. Physicians should not overlook the patient's physical signs related to various adverse events after ESD.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the prevalence and associated factors of persistent symptoms despite a strict gluten-free diet in adult patients with coeliac disease diagnosed in childhood. Medical data on 239 currently adult patients with paediatric diagnosis were collected from patient records. Also, patients completed structured study questionnaire. All variables were compared between those with and without persistent symptoms. Altogether 180 patients reported adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. Of these, 18% experienced persistent symptoms, including various gastrointestinal symptoms (73%), arthralgia (39%), fatigue (39%), skin symptoms (12%) and depression (6%). Those reporting persistent symptoms had more often gastrointestinal comorbidities (19% vs 6%, p=0.023), health concerns (30% vs 12%, p=0.006) and experiences of restrictions on daily life (64% vs 43%, p=0.028) than the asymptomatic subjects. The patients with symptoms had poorer general health (median score 13 vs 14, p=0.040) and vitality (15 vs 18, p=0.015) based on a validated Psychological General Well-Being Questionnaire and more severe symptoms on a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale scale (total score 2.1 vs 1.7, p<0.001). Except for general health, these differences remained significant after adjusting for comorbidities. The groups were comparable in current sociodemographic characteristics. Furthermore, none of the childhood features, including clinical, serological and histological presentation at diagnosis, and adherence and response to the diet after 6-24 months predicted symptom persistence in adulthood. Almost one-fifth of adult patients diagnosed in childhood reported persistent symptoms despite a strict gluten-free diet. The ongoing symptoms were associated with health concerns and impaired quality of life.",

        "Abstract": "Portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome that consists of hypersplenism, ascites, gastroesophageal varices, and encephalopathy. This condition is marked by increased portal pressure gradient and may occur with or without liver cirrhosis. To date, portal hypertension remains as the leading cause of severe complications and death of a patient with chronic liver disease, especially liver cirrhosis. Therefore, thorough understanding about management of portal hypertension is strongly required, especially considering that many complications of portal hypertension require early diagnosis and treatment to improve the prognosis of the patients. Additionally, although hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement has become a gold standard procedure for measuring portal pressure in the last twenty years, utilization of this method in Indonesia has been hindered by reluctance of the patients due to its invasiveness, high cost, and limited availability. This consensus is developed with evidence-based medicine principles to provide a guideline for portal hypertension management for general practitioners, specialists, and consultants, to achieve better clinical outcomes of portal hypertension in Indonesia.  Keywords: portal hypertension, liver cirrhosis, chronic liver disease.",

        "Abstract": "Retinal drusen are deposits of inflammatory proteins that are found in macular degeneration and glomerulonephritis and result, in part, from complement activation. This was a cross-sectional observational study of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) recruited from a Gastroenterology clinic who underwent non-mydriatic retinal photography. Deidentified images were examined for drusen, and drusen counts and size were compared with matched controls, and examined for clinical associations. The cohort with IBD comprised 19 individuals with ulcerative colitis, 41 with Crohn's disease and three with indeterminate colitis, including 34 males (54%) and an overall median age of 48 (IQR 23) years. Their median IBD duration was 7 (IQR 10) years, median CRP level was 7 (IQR 14) mg/L, and 28 (44%) had complications (fistula, stricture, bowel resection etc.), while 28 with Crohn's disease (68%) had colonic involvement. Drusen counts were higher in IBD than controls (12 ± 34, 3 ± 8 respectively, p = 0.04). Counts ≥ 10 were also more common (14, 22%, and 4, 6%, p = 0.02, OR 4.21, 95%CI 1.30 to 13.63), and associated with longer disease duration (p = 0.01, OR 1.06, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.13), an increased likelihood of complications (p = 0.003, OR 6.90, 95%CI 1.69 to 28.15) and higher CRP levels at recruitment (p = 0.008, OR1.02, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.05). Increased retinal drusen were found in all four individuals with Crohn's disease and IgA glomerulonephritis. IBD and drusen may share pathogenetic mechanisms and underlying risk factors such as complement activation.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> To explore the role of computed tomography (CT) severity index (CTSI) and modified CT severity index (MCTSI) in assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) under the revised Atlanta classification (RAC) and predicting the clinical prognosis. <b>Methods:</b> Based on the prospectively entered AP database, the clinical data of consecutive adult AP inpatients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2012 to December 2020 were retrospectively screened. The imaging data were independently evaluated by two radiologists and entered to the database to calculate the CTSI and MCTSI scores. Their relationship with the difference of RAC severity grade and clinical prognosis was analyzed. Compared with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment Ⅱ (APACHE Ⅱ) score, the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of CTSI and MCTSI scores for persistent organ failure and infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN). <b>Results:</b> A total of 2 612 patients with AP, aged (50±15) years, were included in the study, including 1 547 males (59.2%) and 1 065 females (40.8%). According to RAC standard, AP was divided into 699 cases (26.8%) of mild pancreatitis (MAP), 1 098 cases (42.0%) of moderately severe pancreatitis (MSAP), and 815 cases (31.2%) of severe pancreatitis (SAP). MCTSI judged AP severity similarly to RAC, with 668 cases of MAP (25.6%), 1 207 cases of MSAP (46.2%) and 737 cases of SAP (28.2%), while CTSI judged SAP patients less(400 cases, 15.3%). The severity of AP determined by CTSI and MCTSI scores was significantly correlated with clinical prognosis (<i>r</i>=0.06-0.43, all <i>P</i><0.05). Compared with APACHE Ⅱ score, CTSI had the highest area under the curve (AUC) for predicting IPN (AUC=0.85, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.83-0.87), followed by MCTSI (AUC=0.82, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.80-0.85). APACHE Ⅱ was more accurate in predicting persistent organ failure than CTSI and MCTSI scores,with AUC of 0.73 (95%<i>CI</i>: 0.71-0.75)<i>,</i> 0.72 (95%<i>CI</i>: 0.70-0.74) and 0.72 (95%<i>CI</i>: 0.70-0.74), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> AP severity judged by MCTSI is consistent with RAC, and SAP patients judged by CTSI are less than RAC. CTSI and MCTSI are significantly correlated with clinical prognosis. CTSI and MCTSI have higher accuracy in predicting IPN, but lower accuracy in predicting persistent organ failure than APACHE Ⅱ.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has increased barriers to accessing preventive healthcare. This study identifies populations disproportionately underrepresented in screening and surveillance colonoscopies during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this single-center cohort study, colonoscopy procedures were reviewed during 6-month intervals before the pandemic (July 1, 2019 - December 31, 2019) and during the pandemic (July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021 - June 30, 2021). 7095 patients were categorized based on procedure indication, demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Statistics performed using VassarStats. 2387 (2019) colonoscopies pre-pandemic and 2585 (2020) and 2123 (2021) during the pandemic were identified. There was a decrease in colonoscopies performed during months when COVID-19 cases peaked. The total number of average CRC risk patients presenting for first colonoscopy declined during the pandemic: 232 (10 %) pre-pandemic to 190 (7 %) in 2020, 145 (7 %) in 2021 (p < 0.001). Fewer of these patients presented from highly vulnerable communities, SVI > 0.8, during the pandemic, 39 in 2019 vs 16 in 2020 and 22 in 2021. Of all screening and surveillance patients, fewer presented from communities with SVI > 0.8 during the pandemic, 106 in 2019 versus 67 in 2020 and 77 in 2021. It is important to address the decline in CRC preventive care during this pandemic among average CRC risk first-time screeners and vulnerable community patients. An emphasis on addressing social determinants of health and establishing patients in gastroenterology clinics is imperative to promote future health in these populations.",

        "Title": "Acute Abdomen from Spontaneous Splenic Artery Rupture with Coincidental Metastatic Disease: A Case Report.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Splenic artery rupture is a rare surgical occurrence, often with fatal results. The reported prevalence is 0.1-0.2%. Splenic artery rupture can be from atraumatic or traumatic causes. Clinical presentation can vary from being asymptomatic to having an acute abdomen presentation if the splenic artery ruptures. Various imaging studies such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and Doppler ultrasound can be used to determine the morphology and location of the aneurysm. Surgical treatment options are aneurysm resection or simple ligation and splenectomy. CASE REPORT We present the case of an 84-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department after having an episode of syncope. Upon admission, the patient had an acute rupture of the splenic artery aneurysm with large-volume hemoperitoneum, with extensive hepatic and periportal nodal metastases. Interventional radiology was immediately consulted for an emergent splenic artery embolization. He then underwent a liver biopsy, showing poorly differentiated carcinoma, with elevated AFP, CA 19-9, and CEA. The patient was discharged, and was scheduled to follow up with gastroenterology for an outpatient colonoscopy and with oncology for further staging and treatment. CONCLUSIONS This is a rare case where a patient had an acute splenic artery rupture with underlying hepatic and periportal metastasis, with a primary within the gastroenterology tract, specifically the colon. It is imperative to consider splenic artery aneurysm as a differential diagnosis in patients who present with acute abdomen. This case will bring to light a traumatic cause leading to a delayed diagnosis of metastatic malignancy, with the colon as the primary location.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a common cause of pain and disability with an increasing prevalence among the global population (Hunter and Bierma-Zeinstra in Lancet 393(10182):1745-1759, 2019; Zhang and Jordan in Clinics in Geriatric Medicine 26(3):355-369, 2010). Altered immune responses and low-grade systemic inflammation driven by gut dysbiosis are being increasingly recognized as contributing factors to the pathophysiology of OA (Tan et al. in International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases. https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185X.14123, 2021; Binvignat et al. in Joint, Bone, Spine 88(5):105203, 2021; Ramasamy et al. in Nutrients 13(4):1272, 2021), which increased the interest in the so-called \"gut-joint axis\". The various microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract is commonly referred to as the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is affected by age, sex, and immune system activity as well as medications, environment, and diet (Arumugam in Nature. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09944, 2011). The microbiome is pivotal to maintain host health and contributes to nutrition, host defense, and immune development (Nishida et al. in Clinical Journal of Gastroenterology 11:1-10, 2018). Alterations in this microbiome can induce dysbiosis, which is associated with many human disease states including allergies, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and cancer (Lin and Zhang in BMC Immunology 18(1):2, 2017). A gut-joint axis is proposed as a link involving the gastrointestinal microbiome, the immune response that it induces, and joint health. Emerging evidence has shown that there are specific changes in the microbiome that are associated with osteoarthritis, including increased Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio, <i>Streptococcus spp.</i> prevalence, and local inflammation (Collins in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2015.03.014, 2015; Rios in Science and Reports. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40601-x, 2019; Schott in JCI insight. https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.95997, 2018; Boer et al. in Nature Communications 10:4881, 2019). Both the innate and adaptive immune systems are affected by the gut microbiome and can become dysregulated in dysbiosis which ultimately triggers events associated with joint OA.

        "Abstract": "This study explored the effect of different nutritional nursing support on nutritional status, immune function, postoperative bowel motility, and complications in elderly patients with gastrointestinal tumors during the perioperative period. 300 patients with gastrointestinal tumors treated in the Department of Gastroenterology and anorectal surgery of Hangzhou First People's Hospital Affiliated with the Medical College of Zhejiang University from February 2018 to March 2020 were selected as the research objects in this study. Patients were divided into the early enteral nutrition (EEN) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) groups (150 cases in each group) according to the principle of odd and even admission numbers. The patients in the EEN and TPN groups were given enteral nutrition nursing support and parenteral nutrition nursing support, respectively. The nutritional status, immune function, postoperative bowel motility, and complication rate of the two groups were evaluated 7 days after the operation. The nutritional indexes decreased 3 days after the operation and gradually recovered 7 days after the operation in both groups with different nutritional nursing support. The Hb, TRF, PAB, and ALB indexes in the TPN group were significantly lower than those in the EEN group (<i>P</i> < 0.01). On the 7th day after the operation, the indexes of peripheral blood immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were significantly lower than those in the TPN group, and T lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8, and CD4/CD8) demonstrated that the immunological indexes of patients in the EEN group were significantly higher than those in the TPN group (<i>P</i> < 0.01). In terms of intestinal peristalsis, the time of first exhaust and first defecation in the EEN group was significantly shorter than that in the TPN group (<i>P</i> < 0.01) during the perioperative period. Furthermore, both groups had different degrees of complications, while patients demonstrated a lower complication rate in the EEN group compared to those in the TPN group, suggesting a safer postoperative mode. The results of subgroup analysis showed that the nutritional indexes of the gastric cancer group 7 days after operation were significantly higher than those of the colorectal cancer group under EEN and TPN nutritional support modes. Clinical results have suggested that enteral nutrition nursing support can improve the perioperative nutritional status of elderly patients with gastrointestinal tumors by enhancing the immune function and promoting intestinal peristalsis. Meanwhile, the postoperative EEN mode reduces the rate of complications and demonstrates higher safety. Therefore, it has a high clinical application value.",

        "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted global recommendations to delay non-urgent endoscopic procedures to limit the spread of SARS-COV-2, but such delays had unprecedented impact on the delivery of healthcare. Being a large specialty GI Pathology service, we sought to analyze the effect of the pandemic on the frequency of GI malignancies in our department. Based on the electronic search of departmental pathology records, we compared the total numbers of cancer diagnoses (primary and metastatic) from various GI biopsy sites during the 12-month pre- and post-pandemic periods. We summarized patient demographics and analyzed pertinent histopathologic data. For all GI biopsy sites, the number of intramucosal/invasive malignancies reported during the one-year pre-COVID-19 pandemic (pre-COVID) and post-COVID-19 pandemic national lockdown (post-COVID) observation periods were 146 and 218, respectively. Among these, 32 and 70 malignancies were reported for the first quarter (representing the earliest post-lockdown period), 29 and 53 for the second, 41 and 54 for the third, and 44 and 41 for the fourth quarter. During the first two quarters of the post-COVID observation period, the increase in malignant diagnoses was most profound, showing 119% post-COVID increase compared to the pre-COVID levels. Of the two main primary histologic types of large intestinal carcinomas [adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)], the most profound post-COVID increase was noted in SCCs (136% vs. 58% for ADCs). Compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a major increase in biopsy diagnoses of GI cancers in our department. The most plausible explanations for this trend include inevitable lockdowns to minimize the spread of SAR-COV2, which affected GI endoscopy procedure schedules/re-schedules as well as patient response and adaptation to emerging post-COVID GI healthcare patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic's long-term impact on the health of GI cancer patients will need to be determined through systematic analyses by multi-disciplinary teams.",

Although most findings of HIS are simply incidental discoveries found during screening colonoscopies, the ability to mimic the presentation of inflammatory bowel diseases should prompt consideration of this condition as part of a working differential diagnosis. Herein, we present the case of a 57-year-old bisexual, African American male with a medical history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with an undetectable viral load that presented for an elective, outpatient colonoscopy after experiencing four months of intermittent bloating and hematochezia. Histologic examination of colonic biopsies confirmed a diagnosis of HIS. The nonspecific clinical presentation in the setting of well-controlled HIV makes HIS a formidable diagnostic challenge that requires increased awareness.",

        "Abstract": "Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events that occur before 18 years of age. ACEs have been associated with many negative health problems, including the development of chronic diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain. We investigated the prevalence of ACEs among patients with IBS, identified the types of ACEs commonly related to patients with IBS, and further assessed the impact of ACEs on IBS severity. Methodology A cross-sectional study was performed. The study targeted patients with IBS aged ≥ 18 years who were recruited from gastroenterology outpatient clinics at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. Adults were contacted and invited to take part in the study by completing a survey. Data were collected using two validated questionnaires, the ACE questionnaire for adults and the IBS symptom severity scoring system. Results The study included 109 patients with IBS (59.6% females). The prevalence of ACEs (patients with IBS exposed to at least one ACE) was 63.3%. The most prevalent type was emotional abuse (34.9%), followed by both physical abuse and emotional neglect (28.4%). Females reported significantly more ACEs (p = 0.035) than males. The overall IBS symptoms (r = 0.195, p = 0.043) and abdominal pain (r = 0.240, p = 0.012) severity were significantly correlated with total ACEs score. Conclusions Our findings point to a probable association between ACEs exposure and IBS, demonstrating their long-term impacts on symptoms severity. Further studies are needed to acquire a better understanding of the potential impact of ACEs on IBS.",

        "Abstract": "The global incidence and prevalence of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing, with a notable emergence in developing countries with historically low rates. This suggests that environmental and epigenetic factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD. Epigenetics refers to the study of biological mechanisms that result in a change of phenotype, without an change in the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms drive many biological processes that occur in health, such as development and ageing, and are also implicated in disease, including cancer and other inflammatory diseases. Importantly, identification of cell-type-specific epigenetic mechanisms could lead to the identification of molecular disease subtypes allowing a personalised treatment approach. In this short review, we provide a summary of epigenetic mechanisms operative in mammals, and their potential involvement in IBD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss key challenges associated with investigating epigenetics in IBD and provide potential strategies to overcome these, such as through the use of 'omics' and organoid technologies.",

        "Abstract": "There is concern that use of restrictive therapeutic diets, such as those used in disorders of the gut-brain interaction (DGBI), may increase disordered eating. In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Burton Murray et al. and Peters et al. both demonstrate a high prevalence of disordered eating in patients with gastrointestinal conditions, particularly those with DGBI. Given these findings, it is likely that orthorexia is common in this patient group, although this was not directly examined in these studies. Orthorexia nervosa is described as an obsessive and unsafe focus on eating foods perceived as healthy. This mini-review therefore focuses on orthorexia by conducting a scoping review, as per the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews, aimed to assess the prevalence of orthorexia, and associations between orthorexia and restrictive eating practices. While a wide range of orthorexia prevalence has been reported (0%-97%) across the 57 studies included, no studies assessed prevalence specifically in gastrointestinal conditions. Four of eight studies describing diseases associated with specific dietary patterns suggested that participants who followed a diet for \"digestive issues\" or \"food intolerances\" were at higher orthorexia risk. These results suggest that dietary modifications may be a factor contributing to orthorexia. Additionally, we provide a commentary on the clinical implications of the findings for gastrointestinal conditions including a clinical flow chart. Clinicians should consider if a restrictive diet is appropriate for individuals with DGBI and include screening for disordered eating prior to implementation of dietary modifications. Future prospective studies should evaluate orthorexia within this patient group.",

        "Abstract": "Burnout in the field of gastroenterology is an under-researched phenomenon. So far, only a few studies have dealt with this topic. There are large geographical variations in burnout rates with 16-20% of gastroenterologists in Mexico and Germany being at risk or having burnout, 30-40% in the United Kingdom, and 50-55% in South Korea, Canada, and the USA. The investigation of differential associations of burnout with important factors in gastroenterologists leading to tailored therapy recommendations is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the associations between work satisfaction and burnout in this specialization. We distributed an electronic survey to gastroenterologists organized mainly in the Federal Organization of Gastroenterology in Germany (the BVGD - Bundesverband Gastroenterologie Deutschland). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) were examined regarding their postulated internal structure in our sample of gastroenterologists. Canonical correlations were performed to examine the association between work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians. An acceptable model fit was shown for both the MBI and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire. The canonical correlation analysis resulted in two statistically significant canonical functions with correlations of .62 (p<.001) and .27 (p<.001). The full model across all functions was significant (χ <sup>2</sup> (18) = 386.26, p<.001). Burden, personal rewards, and global item regarding the job situation were good predictors for less exhaustion, while patient care and professional relations were good predictors for personal accomplishment. This supports the recognition of burnout as being a multidimensional construct which has to be thoroughly diagnosed. Specific interventions should be designed to improve symptoms of burnout in endoscopy physicians according to their individual complaints as burnout is a multidimensional construct. Differential interventions should be offered on the basis of our study results in order to alleviate the issue of work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians.",

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is classically associated with IBD, but other rheumatic manifestations may occur. To characterize musculoskeletal symptoms and rheumatic diseases in an IBD cohort. Retrospective monocentric descriptive study including all the patients with IBD consecutively referred from Gastroenterology to the Reumatology Department (from January of 2013 to April of 2021) in a Portuguese tertiary university hospital. Demographic and clinical data were collected and musculoskeletal symptoms and rheumatic diseases diagnosed in the Rheumatology outpatient center were registered. A total of 235 patients were included: 177 (75.3%) with Crohn´s disease (CD) and 58 (24.7%) with ulcerative colitis. Musculoskeletal symptoms were observed in 142 (60.4%) patients and 105 (44.7%) had some rheumatic condition. Regarding spondyloarthritis, 46 (19.6%) patients fulfilled ASAS (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society) criteria for axial SpA and 5 (2.1%) for peripheral SpA. Osteoarthritis (n=70, 29.8%) and osteoporosis (n=33, 14%) were the most frequent non-inflammatory rheumatic conditions observed, mostly previously undiagnosed. No significant differences were observed between CD and UC. Rheumatic conditions are frequent in IBD patients and are not limited to SpA features. They remain mostly undiagnosed and the collaboration between gastroenterologists and rheumatologists is important for their best management.",

        "Abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are complex illnesses characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms, with no underlying organic pathology. They are common, chronic, recurrent, and disabling disorders that significantly impair quality of life (QoL). The aim of the present cross-sectional analytical study was to assess QoL and its correlates in adult patients with FGIDs. A cross-sectional, observational, hospital-based study was conducted at the gastroenterology outpatient department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. The ROME IV diagnostic criteria were used to identify the FGIDs. Anxiety, depression, coping strategies, social support, and QoL were assessed by the hospital anxiety and depression scale, the coping strategies inventory, the multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the functional digestive disorders quality-of-life questionnaire, respectively. Of the 52 consecutive patients diagnosed with FGIDs, functional dyspepsia (51.92%) and irritable bowel syndrome (40.38%) were the most common. There were no significant associations between sociodemographic variables (age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status, educational level, employment, occupation, dietary pattern) and QoL scores (all p values >0.05). Duration and social support were not significantly associated with QoL (all p values >0.05). In contrast, psychological variables, such as disengagement coping (r=-0.344, p=0.012), depression (r=-0.600, p=0.000), and anxiety (r=-0.590, p=0.000), were significantly correlated with QoL. Despite advances in neurogastroenterology, patients continue to be disabled by FGIDs. Psychological factors, especially depression, significantly contribute to poor QoL in those patients and should be addressed in a holistic, multidisciplinary way. The biopsychosocial framework, as it applies to FGIDs, should lead to the inclusion of psychosocial assessments in the clinical management and research of those disorders.",

Our aim in the present study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of the CAR in determining the clinical severity of acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). A retrospective study on 200 UC patients that were admitted to the Gastroenterology unit of the Alexandria University, over an 8-year period from January 2012 to January 2020, was conducted. Patient demographic data, laboratory values, and clinical and endoscopic disease activity scores were evaluated. C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin levels were recorded. The CAR was calculated to determine clinical severity. Of the 200 patients, 135 (67.5%) were men and 65 (32.5%) were women. Mean age was 43.5 ± 9.8 years. Patients were divided into groups with mild, moderate, or severe disease activity and there were statistically significant differences in the CAR, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP levels, and albumin levels (p = 0.001; p < 0.05). With a cut-off value of 0.6, the CAR performed best in defining patients with severe disease, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.985, 98% sensitivity, 100% specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97%, p < 0.001. AUC values for the diagnosis of severe disease were 0.985, 0.88, 0.72, and 0.65 for the CAR, CRP, albumin, and the ESR, respectively. There was a statistically significant association between the CAR and clinical disease activity in patients with UC. The CAR is a reliable and practical tool for detecting ASUC.",

Claims databases, which have a large sample size, can be useful for IBD research. However, it is unclear whether the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes alone can correctly identify IBD. We aimed to develop algorithms to identify IBD in claims databases. We used claims data from the Department of Gastroenterology, Tohoku University Hospital from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020. We developed 11 algorithms by combining the ICD-10 code, prescription drug, and workup information. We had access to the database which contains all the information for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients who visited our department, and we used it as the gold standard. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value for each algorithm. We enrolled 19,384 patients, and among them, 1012 IBD patients were identified in the gold standard database. Among 11 algorithms, Algorithm 4 (ICD-10 code and ≥1 prescription drugs) showed a strong performance (PPV, 94.8%; sensitivity, 75.6%). The combination of an ICD-10 code and prescription drugs may be useful for identifying IBD among claims data.",

        "Abstract": "Climate change and the destruction of ecosystems by human activities are among the greatest challenges of the 21st century and require urgent action. Health care activities significantly contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases and waste production, with gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy being one of the largest contributors. This Position Statement aims to raise awareness of the ecological footprint of GI endoscopy and provides guidance to reduce its environmental impact. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA) outline suggestions and recommendations for health care providers, patients, governments, and industry. MAIN STATEMENTS 1: GI endoscopy is a resource-intensive activity with a significant yet poorly assessed environmental impact. 2: ESGE-ESGENA recommend adopting immediate actions to reduce the environmental impact of GI endoscopy. 3: ESGE-ESGENA recommend adherence to guidelines and implementation of audit strategies on the appropriateness of GI endoscopy to avoid the environmental impact of unnecessary procedures. 4: ESGE-ESGENA recommend the embedding of reduce, reuse, and recycle programs in the GI endoscopy unit. 5: ESGE-ESGENA suggest that there is an urgent need to reassess and reduce the environmental and economic impact of single-use GI endoscopic devices. 6: ESGE-ESGENA suggest against routine use of single-use GI endoscopes. However, their use could be considered in highly selected patients on a case-by-case basis. 7: ESGE-ESGENA recommend inclusion of sustainability in the training curricula of GI endoscopy and as a quality domain. 8: ESGE-ESGENA recommend conducting high quality research to quantify and minimize the environmental impact of GI endoscopy. 9: ESGE-ESGENA recommend that GI endoscopy companies assess, disclose, and audit the environmental impact of their value chain. 10:  ESGE-ESGENA recommend that GI endoscopy should become a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions practice by 2050.",

Secukinumab has been linked with exacerbation of and de novo cases of inflammatory bowel disease. However, lymphocytic colitis in association with this drug has not been documented. The management of drug-induced lymphocytic colitis is complicated, as patients frequently exhibit spontaneous remission of symptoms. Removal of the offending agent has shown some benefit; however, some patients continue to exhibit symptoms months after drug cessation and washout. Although our patient's lymphocytic colitis was benign and responded to the cessation Secukinumab, it is an important diagnosis to consider in patients with new onset relapsing diarrhea treated with biologics.",

        "Abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the most common pancreatic disease. Predicting the severity of AP is critical for making preventive decisions. However, the performance of existing scoring systems in predicting AP severity was not satisfactory. The purpose of this study was to develop predictive models for the severity of AP using machine learning (ML) algorithms and explore the important predictors that affected the prediction results. The data of 441 patients in the Department of Gastroenterology in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The demographic data, blood routine and blood biochemical indexes, and the CTSI score were collected to develop five different ML predictive models to predict the severity of AP. The performance of the models was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The important predictors were determined by ranking the feature importance of the predictive factors. Compared to other ML models, the extreme gradient boosting model (XGBoost) showed better performance in predicting severe AP, with an AUC of 0.906, an accuracy of 0.902, a sensitivity of 0.700, a specificity of 0.961, and a F1 score of 0.764. Further analysis showed that the CTSI score, ALB, LDH, and NEUT were the important predictors of the severity of AP. The results showed that the XGBoost algorithm can accurately predict the severity of AP, which can provide an assistance for the clinicians to identify severe AP at an early stage.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy that is caused by both environmental (gluten) and genetic (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes) factors. Patients may be asymptomatic or exhibit atypical symptoms, necessitating a high index of suspicion for proper diagnosis. The evaluation of CD patients with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT imaging can be difficult, owing to the fact that this disease is inflammatory in nature. Typical <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT gastrointestinal manifestations of celiac disease include increased multifocal or diffuse bowel uptake, whereas single short segmental uptake is rarely encountered; thus, awareness of this wide range of findings is important to guide physicians through proper management and outcome. We report a case of small intestine adenocarcinoma and known CD complaining of recent episodes of diarrhea and weight loss that had a suspicious small bowel wall thickening that corresponds to a short segmental hypermetabolic process on FDG PET/CT follow-up scan. The patient was then referred to the gastroenterology department and underwent a colonoscopy, a biopsy was taken that revealed CD and was negative for malignancy. Furthermore, 6 months later the abovementioned segmental FDG activity was completely resolved without any treatment received at the given time.",

The last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline for the management of dyspepsia was published in 1996. In the interim, substantial advances have been made in understanding the complex pathophysiology of FD, and there has been a considerable amount of new evidence published concerning its diagnosis and classification, with the advent of the Rome IV criteria, and management. The primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, is to review and summarise the current evidence to inform and guide clinical practice, by providing a practical framework for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of patients. The approach to investigating the patient presenting with dyspepsia is discussed, and efficacy of drugs in FD summarised based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of pairwise and network meta-analyses. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. These provide both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, in this guideline, we consider novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need and priorities for future research.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of Cassia fistula syrup (CFS) on geriatric constipation. This clinical trial study was performed on 70 aged patients who were referred to the clinic of gastroenterology of Rouhani Hospital, Babol, North of Iran. Patients were randomly divided into two groups of CFS or Lactulose with a dose of 30 ccs/day. Patients were visited two weeks after entering the study to evaluate the frequency of defecation, feeling of incomplete emptying after defecation, manual maneuver, consistency of stool, and also the quality of life. The frequency of defecation per week varied from 1.82 ± 1.16 to 8.36 ± 3.44 in the CFS group after 2 weeks of intervention that was significantly more than the Lactulose that changed from 2.16 ± 1.46 to 5.66 ± 2.96 (P-value = 0.023, partial eta square = 0.079, NNT = 4). The quality of life, the percent of straining, lumpy or hard stool, pain during defecation, and the consistency of stool based on VAS were significantly better in the CFS group. The sensation of incomplete defecation, anorectal obstruction, and manual maneuvering were not different significantly between groups. CFS can be more effective than Lactulose on geriatric constipation.",

        "Title": "A No-Biopsy Approach for the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease in Adults: Can It Be Real?",
        "Abstract": "Background and objective Pediatric guidelines on the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) have reported that the positivity of anti-endomysium antibodies in the presence of anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TGA) 10 times higher than normal is sufficient for the diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether this diagnostic process for children can also be applied to adult patients. Materials and methods We retrospectively examined patients aged >18 years who were diagnosed with CD. The results of serological tests and endoscopic biopsy were evaluated. Patients with more than one month of duration between celiac serology and endoscopy, those diagnosed with CD before admission, those on a gluten-free diet, and those with selective IgA deficiency were excluded from the study. Results A total of 269 patients were included in the study. TGA value was significantly higher in patients with villous atrophy (p<0.001) and positively correlated with mucosal damage (r=0.60, p<0.01). Considering the cut-off value of 100 U/mL (>10 ULN) for the TGA antibodies, in line with the criteria regulated by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) for the diagnosis of CD, the sensitivity was 71.64%, the specificity was 100%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 100%. When the cut-off value was taken as 29.42 U/mL, the sensitivity was 100% and the specificity was 99.5%. For a TGA cut-off value of 52.7 U/mL (5.27 ULN), which determines the presence of partial or complete villous atrophy in the evaluation made considering mucosal damage, the sensitivity was 90%, the specificity was 100%, and the PPV was 100%. Conclusion Based on our findings, TGA titers were highly effective in demonstrating CD-related mucosal damage. This study endorses a biopsy-free strategy in adult patients in line with the ESPGHAN criteria. Local validation of test-specific thresholds will ensure that this approach has a significant impact on adult patients.",

        "Abstract": "Promoting adult neurogenesis in the enteric nervous system (ENS) may be a potential therapeutic approach to cure enteric neuropathies. Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are the most abundant glial cells in the ENS. Accumulating evidence suggests that EGCs can be a complementary source to supply new neurons during adult neurogenesis in the ENS. In the brain, astrocytes have been intensively studied for their neuronal conversion properties, and small molecules have been successfully used to induce the astrocyte-to-neuron transition. However, research on glia-to-neuron conversion in the ENS is still lacking. In this study, we used GFAP-Cre:Rosa-tdTomato mice to trace glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation in the ENS in vivo and in vitro. We showed that GFAP promoter-driven tdTomato exclusively labelled EGCs and was a suitable marker to trace EGCs and their progeny cells in the ENS of adult mice. Interestingly, we discovered that RepSox or other ALK5 inhibitors alone induced efficient transdifferentiation of EGCs into neurons in vitro. Knockdown of ALK5 further confirmed that the TGFβR-1/ALK5 signalling pathway played an essential role in the transition of EGCs to neurons. RepSox-induced neurons were Calbindin- and nNOS-positive and displayed typical neuronal electrophysiological properties. Finally, we showed that administration of RepSox (3, 10 mg· kg<sup>-1</sup> ·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 2 weeks significantly promoted the conversion of EGCs to neurons in the ENS and influenced gastrointestinal motility in adult mice. This study provides a method for efficiently converting adult mouse EGCs into neurons by small-molecule compounds, which might be a promising therapeutic strategy for gastrointestinal neuropathy.",

        "Abstract": "Fatty liver disease is a global health concern, but in the absence of specific guidelines, current referral patterns differ according to the preferences of the general practitioners. Outpatient Gastroenterology clinics spend futile resources on liver-healthy patients while diagnosing decompensated patients delayed. We aimed to describe referral patterns to a regional outpatient Gastroenterology clinic. We reviewed 9684 referrals from primary care for suspected liver disease in the years 2016-2017, during two years. Data were extracted from the patients' hospital records to assess the clinical workup and patient outcomes until a mean of 43 months after the time of referral. Referrals were categorized as unnecessary (no signs of liver disease), timely (significant fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis), or delayed (decompensated cirrhosis). We included 375 patient referrals from primary care. The main reason for referral was elevated transaminases. More than half (54%) of patients had no signs of liver disease, being unnecessarily referred for evaluation, while 17% had decompensated liver disease and were thus referred too late. Only one-third of patients referred on suspicion of liver disease were referred on time, either before presenting with decompensated liver cirrhosis or with some evidence of significant liver disease, e.g., liver fibrosis. There is a huge unmet need for clinical referral pathways in primary care. Strengths and Limitations of this StudyA strength of this study is the complete mapping of all potential referrals to the outpatient clinic in the two-year period. Instead of retrieving the historic data by ICD-10 diagnosis codes, and reflecting only those patients where the GP clearly suspects liver disease, we have a strong reliance on our methods. We screened all potentially relevant referrals, e.g., referrals due to weight loss or fatigue, which may reflect symptoms of cirrhosis. Thereby we are confident that we have not missed any patients that originally were referred with unspecific symptoms, but after evaluation are diagnosed with liver disease.Another strength of our study is the long follow-up period, which allows us to fully evaluate the course for the individual patient, and the potential later coming diagnoses.Finally, it is a strength of the study that we were not exclusive to one liver disease etiology, both ALD and NAFLD etiology were included in the study.A limitation of this study is the use of historic data, and the fact that it is a single-center study, showing only the referral patterns in one outpatient Gastroenterology clinic.",

        "Abstract": "Palatability of the infant formulas lacking cow milk protein formulas is reported by parents to be an important drawback. The purpose of this study is to examine decisions made by mothers of infants having cow milk protein allergy, and physicians concerning the palatability of unflavored extensively hydrolyzed formulas and amino acid-based formulas. We conducted a multi-center, randomized, single-blinded, observational taste study involving 149 pediatricians from gastroenterology and allergy subspecialties at 14 tertiary healthcare units from different regions of Turkey and involving 94 mothers of infants with cow milk protein allergy. Blinding was performed for seven formulas available in the market, which were the most commonly prescribed for feeding: four AAFs (Neocate-Numil<sup>®</sup>, Aptamil Pregomin AS-Numil<sup>®</sup>, Alfamino-Nestle<sup>®</sup>, Comidagen-Mamma<sup>®</sup>), one AAF specifically designed to address the growing nutritional and lifestyle needs of children >1 year (Neocate Junior-Numil<sup>®</sup>), 2 eHFs (Bebelac Pepti Junior-Numil<sup>®</sup>, Similac Alimentum-Abott<sup>®</sup>). Considering all three formula characteristics, Neocate junior-Numil<sup>®</sup> ranked as the number 1 product among seven products by mothers (63.8%) and physicians (69.8%). The ratings of mothers were significantly higher than the physicians (8.1 points and 6.1 points, respectively; p < 0.001). No difference was found in terms of taste, smell, and appearance for Neocate junior-Numil<sup>®</sup> between the mothers' and physicians' ratings. Since caregivers have responsibility for careful selection of replacement products for infants with cow milk protein allergy, it is noteworthy that increased awareness and confidence in the palatability characteristics of these products should motivate mothers and physicians to comply with replacement treatment in the long term.",

        "Title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update on New Technology and Innovation for Surveillance and Screening in Barrett's Esophagus: Expert Review.",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of this best practice advice (BPA) article from the Clinical Practice Update Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association is to provide an update on advances and innovation regarding the screening and surveillance of Barrett's esophagus. The BPA statements presented here were developed from expert review of existing literature combined with discussion and expert opinion to provide practical advice. Formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of BPAs was not the intent of this clinical practice update. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Screening with standard upper endoscopy may be considered in individuals with at least 3 established risk factors for Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma, including individuals who are male, non-Hispanic white, age >50 years, have a history of smoking, chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, or a family history of BE or esophageal adenocarcinoma. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Nonendoscopic cell-collection devices may be considered as an option to screen for BE. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Screening and surveillance endoscopic examination should be performed using high-definition white light endoscopy and virtual chromoendoscopy, with endoscopists spending adequate time inspecting the Barrett's segment. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Screening and surveillance exams should define the extent of BE using a standardized grading system documenting the circumferential and maximal extent of the columnar lined esophagus (Prague classification) with a clear description of landmarks and the location and characteristics of visible lesions (nodularity, ulceration), when present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Advanced imaging technologies such as endomicroscopy may be used as adjunctive techniques to identify dysplasia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Sampling during screening and surveillance exams should be performed using the Seattle biopsy protocol (4-quadrant biopsies every 1-2 cm and target biopsies from any visible lesion). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Wide-area transepithelial sampling may be used as an adjunctive technique to sample the suspected or established Barrett's segment (in addition to the Seattle biopsy protocol). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with erosive esophagitis should be biopsied when concern of dysplasia or malignancy exists. A repeat endoscopy should be performed after 8 weeks of twice a day proton pump inhibitor therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Tissue systems pathology-based prediction assay may be utilized for risk stratification of patients with nondysplastic BE. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Risk stratification models may be utilized to selectively identify individuals at risk for Barrett's associated neoplasia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Given the significant interobserver variability among pathologists, the diagnosis of BE-related neoplasia should be confirmed by an expert pathology review. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Patients with BE-related neoplasia should be referred to endoscopists with expertise in advanced imaging, resection, and ablation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: All patients with BE should be placed on at least daily proton pump inhibitor therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Patients with nondysplastic BE should undergo surveillance endoscopy in 3 to 5 years. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: In patients undergoing surveillance after endoscopic eradication therapy, random biopsies should be taken of the esophagogastric junction, gastric cardia, and the distal 2 cm of the neosquamous epithelium as well as from all visible lesions, independent of the length of the original BE segment.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic atrophic gastritis is a very common condition in the general clinical practice of gastroenterology. Tuina treatment is widely used clinically. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms of tuina in rats with chronic atrophic gastritis. Fifty-six specific pathogen-free grade rats were employed for our study. They were divided into 5 groups and treated differ- ently. Body weight was recorded every week, and their small intestine propulsive ratio was measured after intragastric administration of carbon powder. Histopathological observation of gastric tissues was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of motilin and gastrin in serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression levels of Bcl-2 and cytochrome C were measured by the western blot assay. There was no significant difference in body weight and small intestine propulsive ratio between the chronic atrophic gastritis model group and the tuina group (P > .05). However, we can see some significant changes in histomorphology after treatment with tuina. For example, the atrophy of gastric mucosal epithelium and glands had improved, and the inflammatory cells infiltrating the lamina propria were decreased significantly. Moreover, the level of gastrointestinal hormone GAS was increased (P < .001), and there was no statistically significant difference in motilin, Bcl-2, and cytochrome-c after treatment with tuina (P > .05). Our research demonstrated the effectiveness of tuina treatment on chronic atrophic gastritis with a possible underlying mechanism that affected the secretion of gastric acid, which could provide some useful information for clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most frequent food allergy in the first year of life. There is no clear consensus regarding its prevention. A recommendation to avoid CMP in the first week of life as a preventive measure in all infants, regardless of their atopic risk, has recently been published. The purpose of this document is to issue a recommendation on the use of extensively hydrolyzed CMP formulas in the first week of life for the primary prevention of CMPA. A group of experts was formed with members proposed by the Spanish Association of Pediatrics (AEP), the Spanish Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergology and Pediatric Asthma (SEICAAP), the Spanish Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Society of Neonatology (SENEO). The group conducted a critical review of the evidence on the subject published in the last 10 years. The search yielded 72 studies, of which 66 were rejected for not meeting the inclusion criteria. The final review included 6 documents: 3 clinical trials and 3 systematic reviews, 2 of them with meta-analysis. There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of CMPA in the infants who received hypoallergenic formulae or exclusive breastfeeding. Based on the current evidence, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions about the effect of avoiding CMP in the first week of life for prevention of CMPA. Although there are data that suggest a certain beneficial effect of avoiding CMPA in atopic risk infants, these results are not conclusive enough to extend the recommendation to the general population.",

        "Abstract": "Prior work from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) showed HCV prevalence in China in 2012-2015 being in the upper third and HCV incidence the 2nd highest among 15 different countries/regions investigated. The goal of the present investigation was to: (1) determine if HCV prevalence and incidence has changed, and (2) collect detailed data to understand how HCV is treated, monitored, and managed in Chinese HD facilities and non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) clinics. Detailed data for 1,700 randomly selected HD patients were reported by 39 randomly selected HD facilities from Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou participating in the DOPPS 7-China study from 2019 to 2021. The study site medical directors completed a survey regarding numerous aspects of HCV treatment and management in HD and ND-CKD patients. In this 2019 to 2021 cohort, HCV prevalence was 7.4%, which was lower than the 14.8 and 11.5% HCV prevalence for the 2009-2011 and 2012-2015 cohorts, respectively. HCV incidence of 1.2 cases per 100 pt-yrs also was lower compared to the incidence of 2.1 for the 2012-2015 cohort. Although the great majority of study site medical directors indicated that all or nearly HCV+ patients should be treated for their HCV, very few HCV+ patients have been treated presumably due to substantial cost barriers for affording the new direct acting antivirals (DAAs). The randomly selected facilities in our DOPPS 7-China study appear to have excellent programs in place for frequent monitoring of patients and staff for HCV, education of staff, and referral of HCV cases to external infectious disease, gastroenterology, and liver disease specialists. Liver biopsies were not commonly performed in HCV+ HD patients. HCV genotyping also was rarely performed in participating units. Our study indicates a 50% decline in HCV prevalence and a >40% decline in HCV incidence in Chinese HD patients over the past 10-12 yrs. Chinese HD facilities and associated specialists appear to be well-equipped and organized for successfully treating and managing their HCV+ HD and CKD patients in order to achieve the WHO goal of eliminating HCV by 2030.",

The top 5 journals in general pediatrics, general neurology and neurology subspecialties were identified using the 2017 Journal Citations Report (JCR). For general pediatric journals, we selected 4 pediatric subspecialties for comparison of publication patterns with neurology: immunology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and respirology. For general neurology and neurology subspecialty journals, we searched both the top 5 neurology and neurology subspecialty journals for pediatric articles. Using Ovid Medline, we identified articles published between 2009-2017. With regards to child neurology-based articles, 1501 were published in general pediatrics journals, 643 in general neurology journals and 685 in neurology subspecialty journals. Examination of the top pediatric journals revealed that <i>Pediatrics</i> published the most neurology-based articles. Neurology-based studies were published more frequently than other pediatric subspecialty studies. Of the top general neurology <i>Neurology</i> published the most child neurology-based articles, while <i>Epilepsia</i> published the most child neurology-based articles out of neurology subspecialty journals. Cohort studies were the most frequent study type across all journals. Our study revealed that child neurology articles are published more often in pediatric journals as opposed to general neurology and neurology subspecialty journals. We also found that in general pediatric journals, neurology-based articles are published more frequently compared to other specialties. Our results provide guidance to authors when considering submission of their pediatric neurology research.",

        "Abstract": "To determine the population prevalence and associated health impairment of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) across Great Britain, and the emphasis placed upon them within medical education. An Internet-based cross-sectional health survey was completed by 1906 general population adults across Great Britain without self-reported organic GI disease. The survey enquired for demographics, symptom-based criteria for Rome IV DGBI, healthcare use, non-GI somatic symptoms, and quality of life. As a separate analysis, we evaluated which DGBI are considered core knowledge at undergraduate medical school level and post-graduate specialization level for Gastroenterologists and General Practitioners. The overall prevalence of DGBI across Great Britain was 37%, being similar for England (37%), Scotland (33%), and Wales (36%); p = 0.66. There was no difference between English regions (range 33%-43%, p = 0.26). The prevalence of DGBI was highest in those aged 18-40 years (40%), then 40-64 years (37%), and least amongst those ≥65 years (29%); p < 0.001. The most common DGBI were bowel disorders (30%), followed by gastroduodenal (10.5%), anorectal (8.1%) and oesophageal disorders (6.2%). Individuals with DGBI were significantly more likely than those without DGBI to have increased GI-related healthcare visits, medication use, surgical interventions, non-GI somatic symptoms, and reduced quality of life. One-in-three people with DGBI had multiple GI organ regions involved and this correlated with increased health impairment (p < 0.001). The only DGBI mentioned across all medical training curricula is irritable bowel syndrome, while the General Practitioner and Gastroenterology Curricula also recognise the outdated term non-ulcer dyspepsia (as opposed to functional dyspepsia). The 2010 Gastroenterology Curriculum also includes functional constipation and disordered defecation, with the incoming 2022 iteration adding in functional upper GI syndromes, functional abdominal pain, and opioid-induced GI disturbances. Disorders of gut-brain interaction are common across Great Britain and incur substantial health impairment. However, they are generally under-taught within the British medical education system. Increasing awareness and education of disorders of gut-brain interaction might improve patient outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Gilbert syndrome (GS) is a disease characterized by mildly elevated indirect serum bilirubin levels due to mutation in the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene, which causes a decrease in uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase enzyme activity. Gilbert syndrome should be considered based on clinical and laboratory findings in differential diagnosis, which can be supported by genetic analysis. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical findings and UGT1A1 mutations of children with Gilbert syndrome. Patients who were admitted to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic and who were considered to have Gilbert syndrome based on clinical and laboratory findings were included in the study. The UGT1A1 analysis was performed by Sanger sequence analysis. A total of 56 children were included in the study. A(TA)7TAA, A(TA)6TAA, and (TA)6/7 allele promoter polymorphism was detected in 75.5%, 22.5%, and 2% of the patients, respectively. Other than these, in 3 patients, 3 different sequence variants associated with GS [c.880_893delinsA (p.Tyr294MetfsTer69) and c.1091C>T(p.Pro365Leu)] were detected. We detected 7 TA repeats in the majority of our patients. A mild bilirubin elevation was determined in cases with 6 repetitions that were not considered risky for Gilbert syndrome. We concluded that the c.880_893delinsA (p.Tyr294MetfsTer69) variant, previously shown to be associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, may also be associated with partial enzyme deficiency leading to the Gilbert syndrome phenotype.",

        "Title": "Recent trends in the antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori in patient with dyspepsia.",
        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the resistance status and to identify the point mutations conferring resistance to clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones among dyspeptic patients in Manisa, Turkey. The study included a sample of 140 patients with an indication for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy randomly selected from 2100 dyspeptic patients attending to the Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit at Manisa Celal Bayar University Hafsa Sultan Hospital between April 2016 and May 2018. A commercially available GenoType Helico DR test was used to detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori and mutations associated with resistance to clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones in biopsy specimens. In total, 116 (82.9%) of 140 biopsies obtained from the same number of dyspeptic patients were positive for H pylori and 82 (approximately 71%) of them harbored resistance mutations in 23SrRNA and/or gyrA. Resistance to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, or both were detected in 43.1% (50/116), 27.6% (32/116), and 16/116 (13.8%) of tested biopsies, respectively. The most common mutation conferring resistance to clarithromycin was A2147G (96%, 48/50). Resistance to fluoroquinolones was frequently due to mutation in codon 91 and the most common mutation detected was D91G (34.4%). Heteroresistance patterns were observed in 48.0% (24/50) of clarithromycin-resistant samples and 28.1% (9/32) of levofloxacin-resistant samples. The resistance rates and detected mutations in this study are in line with the country data. However, to achieve better H pylori eradication and to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant strains in Turkey, the molecular-based susceptibility tests should be considered routinely. Further studies are needed to determine the various mutations among resistant strains.",

        "Abstract": "Nonspecific ileitis is inflammation of the ileum without specific diagnostic features. A minority may go on to develop Crohn's disease, but optimal pathways of further investigation have not been established. This study aimed to identify a cohort of patients with nonspecific ileitis and to determine the value of ileal histology and gastrointestinal ultrasound in identifying/excluding Crohn's disease. In a retrospective analysis, all patients having nonspecific ileitis at colonoscopy from January 2010 to August 2021 were identified. Clinical associations with those subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease were examined with specific reference to ileal histology and gastrointestinal ultrasound. Of 29 638 procedures, 147 patients (0.5%) had nonspecific ileitis. Crohn's disease was subsequently diagnosed in 8 patients (5.4%) at a median of 148 (range 27-603) days after colonoscopy. The presence of chronic inflammation on ileal biopsies was more common in those subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease (63% <i>vs</i> 20%; <i>P</i> = 0.0145). On gastrointestinal ultrasound, none of the 26 patients with normal bowel wall thickness (<3 mm) were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and repeat ultrasound in 15 patients 1 year later showed no change. Of the nine patients with abnormal sonographic findings, three were diagnostic for Crohn's disease. Repeat ultrasound revealed Crohn's disease in two, while four had resolution of the abnormal findings. Although ileal histology was of limited value in identifying patients with nonspecific ileitis who were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease, gastrointestinal ultrasound was highly informative. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the value of gastrointestinal ultrasound as a diagnostic and monitoring tool in this setting.",

        "Abstract": "Antibiotics have been used as an adjunct in treating children with severe acute malnutrition 6-59 months of age; however, the data for infants less than 6 months are scarce. The WHO recently started guideline development for preventing and treating wasting, including growth failure/faltering in infants less than 6 months. This systematic review commissioned by WHO aims to synthesise evidence from current literature on the effectiveness of antibiotics for infants less than 6 months of age with growth failure/faltering. We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis for studies that assessed the effect of antibiotics in the treatment of infants with growth faltering. We will search multiple electronic databases. We will include randomised control trials and non-randomised studies with a control arm. The study population is infants less than 6 months of age with growth failure. The intervention group will be infants who received no antibiotics or antibiotics other than recommended in 2013 guidelines by WHO to treat severe acute malnutrition in children. The comparison group will be infants who received antibiotics according to the 2013 guideline by WHO. We will consider the following outcomes: mortality, clinical deterioration, antimicrobial resistance, recovery from comorbidity, adverse events, markers of intestinal inflammation, markers of systemic inflammation, hospital-acquired infections, non-response. We will use the meta-analysis to pool the studies where applicable. We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to reporting the overall evidence quality for an outcome. This is a systematic review and will not involve contact with a human subject. The findings of this review will be published in a peer-review journal and will guide the WHO's recommendation for the use of antibiotics in infants less than 6 months of age with growth failure.

        "Title": "The first Aotearoa New Zealand case of NUDT15-variant-related thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity.",
        "Abstract": "A 37-year-old Han Chinese man, with a history of severe ulcerative colitis with incomplete response to oral glucocorticoids, was commenced on azathioprine [AZA] 200mg once a day. His pre-treatment thiopurine S-methyltransferase [TPMT] levels were in the normal range. Eleven days later he developed symptoms of stomatitis and gingivitis. Chinese herbal medications were taken in an attempt to treat these symptoms. He presented to the emergency department with this, with normal vital signs. A full blood count five days post-onset of symptoms showed pancytopenia with an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of 0.0x10(9)/l, C-reactive protein was 120 mg/L. Initial chest radiograph, urinalysis and peripheral blood cultures were unremarkable and he was commenced on broad spectrum antibiotics and granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]. He remained an inpatient under the gastroenterology team for 16 days and developed infectious complications of herpes simplex stomatitis, oral candidiasis, dental abscess, and scalp abscess. On day 16 his ANC recovered to 1.0x10(9)/L and was discharged from the hospital. He underwent nudix hydrolase 15 [NUDT15] genotyping and was found to have homozygosity for the variant NUDT15:c.415C>T. This case demonstrates the importance of pre-treatment testing for NUDT15 genetic variants, to predict the risk of severe leucopaenia, particularly in a patient of East Asian ethnicity.",

        "Title": "Can artificial intelligence increase the efficiency of referrals from primary to specialized care?",
        "Abstract": "The overload of the current healthcare model makes the search for strategies to improve process efficiency essential. An artificial intelligence (AI) program based on Natural Language Processing pipelines (1-5) was used. It analyzed the referrals from primary care to Gastroenterology in the health area corresponding to our hospital in order to identify the most frequent reasons for consultation and to assign them a protocol for the performance of complementary tests before being seen for the first time in specialized care. We compared all referrals received in the first half of 2018, prior to the implementation of the AI pathway July 2018, with those received in the first half of 2019. Our aim was to evaluate the efficiency of this program in terms of discharges, need for additional tests and the number of follow-up visits required (number of follow-up visits/number of first visits in a given time period, FU/F index). In 2018, 1799 referrals were received, 1309 within our health area and 490 from outside the area. In 2019, 2261 referrals were received, 1392 from our area and 869 out-of-area. The AI pathway was applied to 31.4% of the area-referred patients. Overall, in 2019, the number of blood tests and CT scans requested at the first visit decreased (55.3 vs 61.4% and 4.4 vs 7.4% respectively, p<0.05 for both comparisons). The FU/F index in 2019 was 1.9 ± 0.04 vs 2.26 ± 0.07 in 2018 (p<0.05). When analysing patients from our health area, a higher number of discharges at the first consultation was observed during 2019 The number of requested supplementary exams among patients referred using the AI pathway was reduced compared to 2018. The FU/F index in patients referred using the AI pathway was 1.72 ± 0.08 vs 2.25 ± 0.08 in 2018 (p<0.05) and 1.93 ± 0.07 in those referred through the standard pathway in 2019 (p=0.07). Among patients referred from outside our health area, the number of endoscopies requested in 2019 was higher. The FU/F index improved in 2019 (1.95 ± 0.06 vs 2.29 ± 0.13, p<0.05). The number of patients referred using the AI pathway remains low, which could explain the lack of differences observed in the number of discharges or tests requested compared to patients referred via the standard pathway. However, the number of endoscopies and follow up visits requested for these patients did decrease.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to better understand the psychological experiences of inpatients with acute pancreatitis (AP). We used a qualitative descriptive study design to capture patients with AP's thoughts, feelings and behavioural responses. We conducted this study in the gastroenterology departments of two tertiary hospitals in Eastern China. We used a convenience sampling approach to recruit 28 inpatients with AP from 1 August 2020 to 25 December 2020. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We employed an adapted version of Colaizzi's qualitative analysis approach to examine the data. We extracted three themes and eight subthemes regarding the participants' psychological experiences: (1) feeling that their disease is unpredictable (the inability to recognise the disease, uncertainty about the illness and fear of progression or recurrence); (2) various kinds of stress and support (feeling different degrees of stress, perceiving social support, seeking and craving social support); and (3) developing self-adaptability in the disease process (treating one's illness negatively or positively). Cognitive and emotional responses vary in patients with AP during hospitalisation. Moreover, patients with distinct conditions demonstrate significant differences in their responses and coping mechanisms. Healthcare providers need to mobilise social support and formulate comprehensive intervention strategies according to patients' individual characteristics.",

A quality assessment was based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programs checklist. The included studies focused on the implementation of technology for telehealth, multidisciplinary approach, service satisfaction, guidelines, and medical training. They provided illustrative insight into the strategy of telehealth in different medical specialties, such as pediatric gastroenterology, oncology, ophthalmology, and laryngology. Nonsurgical specialties had the greatest number of telehealth visits. Clinicians showed positive attitudes toward the implementation of video telehealth visits; patients report high levels of satisfaction with this care and strong interest in continuing this modality as a significant portion of clinical practice. This systematic review provided an illustrative insight into the strategy of telehealth for different purposes. According to our findings, telehealth may be used in different medical area with a clear strategy of intervention according to patients' and doctors' needs.",

        "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa. It is a common infectious agent in children. In this study, we aim to evaluate the demographic data, and the clinical and histopathological findings of pediatric patients that underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGSE) in our clinic. Between July 2017 and February 2019, 636 patients applied to the Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Gastroenterology outpatient clinic with complaints of epigastric abdominal pain and/or dyspeptic complaints. Patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were evaluated retrospectively. Data on age, gender, family history of peptic ulcer disease, and family history of H. pylori were recorded. Endoscopic and histopathological findings were collected from medical records. 235 (36.9%) of the patients participating in the study were male, and 401 (63.1%) were female. H. pylori infection was detected in 277 (43.6%) patients as a result of histopathological examination of H. Pylori, urea breath tests and H. Pylori antigen tests in the stools of patients are included in the study. Nodular antral gastritis was detected in 282 (44.3%) of our patients endoscopically. H. pylori was detected in 83.7% (n: 236) of the 282 patients with nodular antral gastritis. Nodular antral gastritis was observed to be significantly higher in H. pylori-positive patients than in H. pylori-negative cases (odds ratio (OR), 39.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 24.88-61.64; p: <0.001). Nodular antral gastritis is caused by chronic H. pylori infection. It is predicted that early detection of H. pylori infection in children is important and may decrease complications later in life. Our study shows that all the markers evaluated are very good predictors of H. pylori infection. Positive significant association was found between the prevalence of H. pylori infection and nodular antral gastritis.",

His medical history was significant for bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and moderately severe ulcerative colitis treated with balsalazide and daily lactobacillus-containing probiotics. Initial investigations revealed <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> bacteraemia without complication. Four days after hospital discharge, the patient experienced acute-onset right-sided paraesthesia and lower-limb paresis. On return to the emergency room, MRI of the brain demonstrated innumerable ring-enhancing lesions with haemorrhagic transformation. Transoesophageal echocardiogram revealed a small mobile density on the bioprosthetic aortic valve, raising the suspicion for <i>L. rhamnosus</i> infective endocarditis with secondary septic emboli to the brain. The patient was subsequently treated with intravenous gentamycin and ampicillin, with transition to indefinite oral amoxicillin suppressive therapy.

        "Abstract": "Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has become the procedure of choice to obtain samples from pancreatic lesions. However, it still has limitations affecting its diagnostic yield. The endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) needle was developed to allow acquisition of histological core. We conducted this study to compare the diagnostic yield of the Echotip 22Gauge FNA needle with the 22Gauge acquire FNB needle in pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions. This prospective study was carried out on 100 cases of pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions referred to El-Ebrashi unit of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, internal medicine department, Kasr Al-Aini hospital. The patients included were then randomized for sampling using either the standard Echotip 22Gauge FNA needle or 22Gauge acquire FNB needle. Patients were 57 males and 43 females with a mean age of 58±15 years. Seventy-eight patients had pancreatic lesions, while twenty-two patients had non-pancreatic lesions. Half of the patients (50 cases) underwent EUS-FNA, and the other half (50 cases) underwent EUS-FNB. The presence of adequate tissue core was significantly higher in the FNB group. In contrast, smear cellularity was not significantly different between both groups. FNB had more sensitivity and accuracy depending on cell block/tissue core examination only for diagnosing pancreatic lesions. Blood contamination was higher in cell blocks of the FNA group. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the combined cytologic and histologic evaluation were 100%. Based on smear only or tissue only, the specificity was 100%, but the sensitivity and accuracy were decreased in both techniques. No complications were reported in both techniques. EUS-guided FNA and FNB are safe with comparable diagnostic accuracy in pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions. FNB improved the histopathological quality of specimens with little blood contamination. Depending on tissue examination only in diagnosing pancreatic lesions, FNB had more sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy.",

        "Title": "A Perfect Storm: Abdominal Pain and Ileus Explained by Acute Intermittent Porphyria Caused by Prehospitalization and Intrahospitalization Factors.",
        "Abstract": "Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease, predominantly seen in female patients, caused by mutations in the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene. When impaired, elevated heme biosynthesis precursor levels accumulate in the liver, resulting in neurological symptoms, psychiatric disturbances, darkened urine color, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and ileus. We present a 22-year-old Hispanic female with diffuse abdominal pain and no bowel movements for 8 days. She reported recent antibiotic and oral contraceptive pill use. Computerized tomography of her abdomen revealed a dilated small bowel and marked colonic distension. A colonoscopy found mild nonspecific inflammation in the rectosigmoid and terminal ileum. Her abdominal pain persisted despite interventions and improvements in appetite, bowel movements, abdominal imaging, and treatment of an identified <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection. A random urine porphobilinogen was then obtained and found to be elevated. Fractionation of plasma and urine porphyrins was suggestive of AIP. Her symptoms improved with 3 days of intravenous (IV) hematin and IV dextrose. This is a unique case of a rare disease due to her clinical presentation with ileus, unremarkable past medical history, family history, and the prehospitalization and intrahospitalization factors that likely exacerbated the patient AIP.",

        "Title": "Outcomes of paediatric patients with chronic liver disease in early adulthood: A heterogeneous, but representative, regional cohort study.",
        "Abstract": "Advances in paediatric hepatology have led to the increasing survival of patients with paediatric-onset chronic hepatobiliary disease into adulthood. Data are lacking with regard to the outcomes of this heterogeneous group of patients and current transition models may be insufficient. This retrospective regional cohort study examined the outcomes of these patients cared for in a paediatric gastroenterology centre following transfer to adult services. A prospective database of paediatric patients with liver disease identified those already transferred to adult services. Following exclusions, medical notes were examined and health parameters recorded including initial diagnoses, transplant status, fertility and mortality. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate follow-up data and transplant-free survival (TFS). Overall, 63 patients (52% male) entered the final analyses with a median follow-up of 27.5 years. The most common diagnosis was biliary atresia (19%); 27 different diagnoses were apparent within the cohort highlighting the heterogeneity within a single centre. Transplant prevalence at adult transfer was 41%; 14% of patients were lost to follow-up including 10% of transplant patients. TFS for biliary atresia was 17% after 37.4 years follow-up and was 54% for the total cohort. There were seven documented pregnancies and the prevalence of any psychological or psychiatric input was 44%. Transplant complications occurred in 38% of patients; there were two cancer diagnoses and two deaths following transfer. Although overall mortality was low, the health-care burden of patients with paediatric-onset chronic liver disease is high. This group is also very heterogeneous, making structured transition to adult services difficult.",

        "Abstract": "It is known that inflammatory bowel disease is the result of a defective immune system, and immunotherapy and biological therapy have gradually become important means to treat it. This paper focused on the bibliometric statistical analysis of the current research progress to summarize the research status of this field and analyze the research trends in recent years. Two visualization tools, CiteSpace and VOSviewer, were used to explore the data of journals, institutions, countries/regions, authors, references, and keywords for the literature included in the Web of Science Core Collection from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2021. A total of 312 papers were published in 120 journals by 603 institutions from 40 countries/regions, with 9463 co-cited references. The United States has the most publications with the highest total citations in the world. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases published the maximum number of papers, and Gastroenterology devoted the most co-citations to immunotherapy and biological therapy for IBD. In addition, we found that the studies before 2009 mostly focused on clinical trials while researchers have paid more attention to clinical management in therapy for IBD since 2009. Combination therapy and management of the treatment for the disease have become research hotspots. The focus of immunotherapy and biotherapy for IBD has shifted from clinical trials to the management of the risks and benefits of immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic, inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. We have initiated a Danish population-based inception cohort study aiming to investigate the underlying mechanisms for the heterogeneous course of IBD, including need for, and response to, treatment. IBD Prognosis Study is a prospective, population-based inception cohort study of unselected, newly diagnosed adult, adolescent and paediatric patients with IBD within the uptake area of Hvidovre University Hospital and Herlev University Hospital, Denmark, which covers approximately 1 050 000 inhabitants (~20% of the Danish population). The diagnosis of IBD will be according to the Porto diagnostic criteria in paediatric and adolescent patients or the Copenhagen diagnostic criteria in adult patients. All patients will be followed prospectively with regular clinical examinations including ileocolonoscopies, MRI of the small intestine, validated patient-reported measures and objective examinations with intestinal ultrasound. In addition, intestinal biopsies from ileocolonoscopies, stool, rectal swabs, saliva samples, swabs of the oral cavity and blood samples will be collected systematically for the analysis of biomarkers, microbiome and genetic profiles. Environmental factors and quality of life will be assessed using questionnaires and, when available, automatic registration of purchase data. The occurrence and course of extraintestinal manifestations will be evaluated by rheumatologists, dermatologists and dentists, and assessed by MR cholangiopancreatography, MR of the spine and sacroiliac joints, ultrasonography of peripheral joints and entheses, clinical oral examination, as well as panoramic radiograph of the jaws. Fibroscans and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans will be performed to monitor occurrence and course of chronic liver diseases, osteopenia and osteoporosis. This study has been approved by Ethics Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (approval number: H-20065831). Study results will be disseminated through publication in international scientific journals and presentation at (inter)national conferences.",

        "Abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated dysbiosis in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, faecal microbiota transplantation, whose effect and safety have been proven in <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections, may hold promise in other conditions, including IBS. Our study will examine the effectiveness of stool transfer with artificially increased microbial diversity in IBS treatment. A three-group, double-blind,randomised, cross-over, placebo-controlled study of two pairs of gut microbiota transfer will be conducted in 99 patients with diarrhoeal or mixed type of IBS. Patients aged 18-65 will be randomised into three equally sized groups: group A will first receive two enemas of study microbiota mixture (deep-frozen stored stool microbiota mixed from eight healthy donors); after 8 weeks, they will receive two enemas with placebo (autoclaved microbiota mixture), whereas group B will first receive placebo, then microbiota mixture. Finally, group C will receive placebos only. The IBS Severity Symptom Score (IBS-SSS) questionnaires will be collected at baseline and then at weeks 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 32. Faecal bacteriome will be profiled before and regularly after interventions using 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing. Food records, dietary questionnaires, anthropometry, bioimpedance, biochemistry and haematology workup will be obtained at study visits during the follow-up period. The primary outcome is the change in the IBS-SSS between the baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention for each patient compared with placebo. Secondary outcomes are IBS-SSS at 2 weeks after the intervention and 32 weeks compared with placebo and changes in the number of loose stools, Bristol stool scale, abdominal pain and bloating, anthropometric parameters, psychological evaluation and the gut microbiome composition. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Thomayer University Hospital, Czechia (G-18-26); study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences and patient group meetings.

        "Abstract": "Determination of the dose-dependent effect of the Teraligen for various nosological forms of disorders in psychiatric practice and general medicine. Analysis of 98 publications included in the database of the RISC (2012-2021) with the identification of disorders (according to ICD-10) in which Teraligen is prescribed or can be used (in adults and children from the age of 7). Despite a rather long and successful history use, research work on the study drug Teraligen continues. Currently Teraligen is widely and actively used by doctors of various specialties in the psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, gerontology, internal medicine, gastroenterology, gynecology, cardiology, endocrinology and other disciplines. The drug is presented in several release forms: Teraligen 5 mg tablets; Teraligen retard 20 mg; Teraligen solution for intravenous injections. Teraligen is characterized by the following psychotropic effects: anxiolytic (++ - a distinct, moderately pronounced effect); sedative (++); hypnotic (++); antidepressant (+ - the effect is distinct, but expressed slightly and does not determine the drug main prescriptions spectrum); antipsychotic (± - the effect is weakly expressed and clinically insignificant when using conventional (5-80 mg/day) drug dosages). According to the authors, the main effect of the «small» neuroleptic/antipsychotic Alimemazine (Teraligen ) is primarily aimed at pathological anxiety and affective instability. Its use is possible in various age groups, as it has a fairly high safety. In addition, like other «small» neuroleptics/antipsychotics with a predominantly sedative effect, the drug can be used to correct neuroleptics-prolongs side effects with dominant manifestations in the form of anxiety, irritability and insomnia.",

        "Abstract": "Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common surgical problem requiring hospitalization in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland. The first UK lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) management guidelines were published in 2019 by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). We aimed to evaluate self-reported adherence to BSG clinical guidance (CG) within the UK and Ireland. A Questionnaire was designed based on LGIB BSG CG 2019 using Google Forms (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA). This was distributed to surgical consultants and senior surgical practitioners (specialists, Trust grade registrars, and specialist registrars) across different centers in the UK and Ireland over four weeks (13th March to 5th April 2021). Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A total of 64 responses were recorded from 18 different centers in the UK and Ireland. The ratio of consultants and registrars was almost the same (34:30, 53.1%:46.9%). The majority of respondents were from colorectal surgery (65.6%, n=42) followed by general surgeons (23.4%, n=15). A total of 41 respondents (64.1%) admitted that BSG CG 2019 were practically applicable at their center. Approximately 75% of respondents did not use or were unaware of the Shock index or Oakland score to stratify patients. That translated into 59% opting to admit patients with a minor bleed. Around 36% wanted to perform a CT angiogram for a stable major bleed, while 37% were unaware of the interventional radiology (IR) referral pathway. There is patchy adherence to the guidelines leading to significant variations in LGIB management practice and avoidable admissions.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major healthcare problem all over the world and screening is effective in reducing mortality and increasing survival. Since colonoscopy has a central role in faecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based CRC screening and surveillance, consistent quality measures are essential to ensure quality and outcomes. Nevertheless, screening modalities in clinical practice may differ according to the centers experience and the local availability of instrumentation and devices. to assess the quality of endoscopic screening for CRC and adherence to international guidelines across Gastroenterology Departments in Italy. All members of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) were invited to answer a web-based survey. Data from 64 hospitals from 17 Italian regions were analyzed. 32/64 (50.0%) were from northern, 12/64 (18.75%) from central and 20/64 (31.25%) from southern Italy. Each center is equipped with a median of 5.0 (3.5-7.0) endoscopists involved in CRC screening, 71.4% of which are gastroenterologists. After a positive FIT, most centers (93.8%) schedule a colonoscopy within 3 months. High-definition video endoscopy is routinely performed in 68.8% and chromoendoscopy in 53.1% of centers. Withdrawal time is ≥6 min in 79.9% and cecal intubation rate is ≥90% in 94.4% of departments. Finally, in 92.7% of centers adenoma detection rate (ADR) overcome the minimum standard of 25%. Analyzing the data by regional areas, a significant higher number of median endoscopic examinations/year (6500 vs 4000 and 3000, respectively, p = 0.024) and of endoscopists per center (6.5 vs 5.0 and 3.5, respectively, p < 0.001) has been registered in the northern compared to central-southern centers. Data from this survey show adequacy and good quality of endoscopic screening for CRC in Italy, highlighting, at the same time, relevant deficiencies and a discrepancy in procedural attitudes between the different centers.

        "Title": "Classifying unstructured electronic consult messages to understand primary care physician specialty information needs.",
        "Abstract": "Electronic consultation (eConsult) content reflects important information about referring clinician needs across an organization, but is challenging to extract. The objective of this work was to develop machine learning models for classifying eConsult questions for question type and question content. Another objective of this work was to investigate the ability to solve this task with constrained expert time resources. Our data source is the San Francisco Health Network eConsult system, with over 700 000 deidentified questions from the years 2008-2017, from gastroenterology, urology, and neurology specialties. We develop classifiers based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, experimenting with multitask learning to learn when information can be shared across classifiers. We produce learning curves to understand when we may be able to reduce the amount of human labeling required. Multitask learning shows benefits only in the neurology-urology pair where they shared substantial similarities in the distribution of question types. Continued pretraining of models in new domains is highly effective. In the neurology-urology pair, near-peak performance is achieved with only 10% of the urology training data given all of the neurology data. Sharing information across classifier types shows little benefit, whereas sharing classifier components across specialties can help if they are similar in the balance of procedural versus cognitive patient care. We can accurately classify eConsult content with enough labeled data, but only in special cases do methods for reducing labeling effort apply. Future work should explore new learning paradigms to further reduce labeling effort.",

Limited resources in Paediatric Gastroenterology in developing countries like Pakistan cause considerable difficulties in managing children with chronic GI diseases in a timely fashion. This retrospective descriptive study aimed to determine the spectrum and outcomes of chronic GI diseases in children. The study was conducted at the Paediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department, Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute & Research Centre (PKLI &RC) in Lahore. The duration of the study was from August 2019 to August 2020. A total of 40 children below the age of 15 years with chronic GI diseases were included. The diagnosis was principally established with the assistance of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and ileo-colonoscopy. Coeliac disease was the most common chronic GI disease. Our systematic approach, in addition to an extensive workup, assisted in the diagnosis and management of the illness, which resulted in a more optimal outcome. Prompt referrals to tertiary centres are recommended where facilities and expertise are available to decrease morbidity and mortality.",

The gene variants leading to monogenic VEO-IBD are often associated with primary immunodeficiency syndromes. A six year-old girl presented to our gastroenterology clinic with LRBA deficiency with a heterozygous mutation at c.1399 A > G, p Met467Val, histopathologic chronic active colitis without granulomas and clinical chronic colitis. Her gastrointestinal symptoms began at age 5 with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Whole exome sequencing revealed a <i>CARD11</i> heterozygous de novo mutation (c.220 + 1G > A). She was in clinical remission on only abatacept. We present a case of monogenic VEO-IBD associated with two heterozygous variants in <i>LRBA1</i> and <i>CARD11,</i> both considered as key players in the newly proposed \"immune TOR-opathies\".",

The association between pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and CRC has been unclear in the past. However, multiple studies showed a positive association between PID and underlying malignancy (gynecologic and pelvic primarily). Several studies evaluated the relation between PID and CRC, but the results were conflicting. We describe a case of a 33-year-old female patient, with a history of PID and recurrent pelvic abscesses, who was found to have CRC. Of note, the patient's diagnosis was based on abnormal computed tomography findings, which were further investigated (by colonoscopy and biopsy), rather than on symptoms suggestive of CRC, such as rectal bleeding, constipation, symptomatic anemia, or abdominal pain.",

        "Abstract": "Telemedicine is being widely implemented in the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid infection risk. However, its effectiveness has not been evaluated, especially in developing countries, where it is invaluable for healthcare access. This study assesses physicians' and patients' perspectives of the usefulness and challenges of telemedicine in the gastroenterology department to identify its pitfalls. A cross-sectional telephonic survey was conducted on patients presenting to the gastroenterology department at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. An online survey was sent to physicians in the department. A total of 160 patients participated, with a mean age 49.8 years, and 42.8% (n=68) males. There were 23.8% (n=38) initial visits and 76.3% (n=122) follow-ups. More than 85% of patients agreed telemedicine saved cost and time, 46.5% (n=74) said it improved healthcare access, and 76.3% (n=122) wanted to use it again. More than 80% were satisfied with the physician-patient interaction. Of the 7 physicians who participated, most felt telemedicine was inadequately facilitated, but felt comfortable with technology. Most felt it did not negatively affect healthcare, but thought it was complex for patients and that lack of physical interaction is a limitation. Nearly half were in favor of continuing its use after the pandemic. Telemedicine is an effective alternative to in-person visits. Patients find it convenient, with adequate interaction. Physicians have reservations that need addressal, such as poor administration. Most patients and half of physicians are welcome to using telemedicine in the post-COVID era.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected emergency department (ED) usage. This study examines changes in the number of ED visits for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and nonemergency GI conditions, such as acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and constipation, before the pandemic and at the peak and slack periods of the pandemic in Taiwan. This retrospective observational study was conducted at a referral medical center in northern Taiwan. We recorded the number of weekly ED visits for GI bleeding, AGE, and constipation from 2019 to 2021. We then compared the baseline period (calendar weeks 4-18 and 21-31, 2019) with two peak pandemic periods (period 1, calendar weeks 4-18, 2020; period 2, calendar weeks 21-31, 2021) and their corresponding slack periods. The decline in the number of ED visits during the two peak pandemic periods for GI bleeding (-18.4% and -30.2%) were not as substantial as for AGE (-64.1% and -76.7%) or for constipation (-44.4% and -63.6%), but GI bleeding cases were still significantly lower in number relative to the baseline. During the slack period, the number of ED visits for all three diagnoses rebounded but did not exceed the baseline. Our study revealed that there was a significant decline of GI complaint during the pandemic. This phenomenon was more prominent in nonemergency complaints (AGE and constipation) and less prominent in serious complaints (GI bleeding).",

        "Abstract": "To examine the prevalence rates of biosimilar discontinuation and switchback to the originator tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) inhibitors following non-medical switch (NMS) in patients. Real-world studies reporting biosimilar discontinuation and switchback rates following NMS published between January 2012 and August 2018 were identified through a systematic literature review. A meta-analysis estimated the annualized discontinuation and switchback rates. A subsequent meta-analysis assessed annualized incremental discontinuation rate among studies reporting both discontinuation rates in patients who underwent an NMS (switchers) and patients who remained on originators (non-switchers). A total of 66 publications were identified: 31 in gastroenterology, 32 in rheumatology, and 3 in both. Half of the studies reported switchback rates; only 9 studies reported discontinuation rates for both switchers and non-switchers. Across studies, the mean/range sample size of the NMS patient population was 136/9-1641; mean/range follow-up was 10/3-24 months. Annualized biosimilar discontinuation rate was 21% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18%, 25%). Switchback rate was 14% (95% CI 10%, 17%) among all NMS patients and 62% (95% CI 44%, 80%) among discontinuers. The mean/range sample size of switchers and non-switchers was 344/89-1621 and 768/19-2870, respectively; mean/range follow-up was 11/6-18 and 12/6-8 months, respectively. Annualized incremental biosimilar discontinuation rate was 18% (95% CI 4%, 31%). Biosimilar discontinuation was found to be prevalent among patients who underwent an NMS from an originator TNF inhibitor to its biosimilar(s) in the real world. In addition, switchback to the originator TNF inhibitors was common following biosimilar discontinuation. Careful consideration is necessary when switching patients already on an originator TNF inhibitor to its biosimilar(s). Main limitations included the heterogeneity of the studies and the limited comparability of the data.",

        "Abstract": "The rate of incidentally detected pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) has increased over the past decade and was recently reported at 8%. These lesions pose a unique challenge, as each subtype of PCL carries a different risk of malignant transformation, ranging from 0% (pancreatic pseudocyst) to 34-68% (main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm). It is imperative to correctly risk-stratify the malignant potential of these lesions in order to provide the correct care course for the patient, ranging from monitoring to surgical intervention. Even with the multiplicity of guidelines (i.e., the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines and Fukuoka/International Consensus guidelines) and multitude of diagnostic information, risk stratification of PCLs falls short. Studies have reported that 25-64% of patients undergoing PCL resection have pancreatic cysts with no malignant potential, and up to 78% of mucin-producing cysts resected harbor no malignant potential on pathological evaluation. Clinicians are now incorporating artificial intelligence technology to aid in the management of these difficult lesions. This review article focuses on advancements in artificial intelligence within digital pathomics, radiomics, and genomics as they apply to the diagnosis and risk stratification of PCLs.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are frequently detected on abdominal images performed for non-pancreatic indications. Their prevalence in asymptomatic population ranges from 2.7 to 24.8%, and increases with age. There are several types of pancreatic cysts. Some may contain cancer or have malignant potential, such as mucinous cystic neoplasms, including mucinous cystadenoma (MCN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). In contrast, others are benign, such as serous cystadenoma (SCA). However, even those cysts with malignant potential rarely progress to cancer. Currently, the only treatment for pancreatic cysts is surgery, which is associated with high morbidity and occasional mortality. The Board of the Chilean Pancreas Club of the Chilean Gastroenterology Society developed the first Chilean multidisciplinary consensus for diagnosis, management, and surveillance of PCN. Thirty experts were invited and answered 21 statements with five possible alternatives: 1) fully agree; 2) partially agree; 3) undecided; 4) disagree and 5) strongly disagree. A consensus was adopted when at least 80% of the sum of the answers \"fully agree\" and \"partially agree\" was reached. The consensus was approved by the Board of Directors of the Chilean Pancreas Club for publication.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of incidental pancreas cystic lesions (PCLs) has increased in recent decades with the expanded use and improved sensitivity of cross-sectional imaging. Because the overall risk of malignancy associated with PCLs is low, yet the relative morbidity of pancreatic surgery is high, evidence-based guidelines are necessary for appropriate surveillance and management. Therefore, this article provides a review of existing guidelines regarding surveillance and management of PCLs and highlights recent advances in the diagnostic evaluation of cysts and the postresection management of mucinous lesions. There are 5 main guidelines related to the management of PCLs: the American Gastrointestinal Association (AGA) guidelines, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommendations, the European evidence-based guidelines, and the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP)/Fukuoka guidelines. These guidelines are based on retrospective studies that do not account or control for most tumor- and patient-specific factors. These guidelines also vary in scope, recommendations for surgical resection vs surveillance, as well as duration and type of follow-up. PCL guidelines should be viewed within the context of the data limitations on which they are based. PCL subtype-specific guidelines on surveillance and treatment are needed. In the future, the integration of cyst-specific genomic analysis, as well as evolutions in advanced diagnostic tools, such as cyst fluid next-generation sequencing and EUS-guided confocal laser endomicroscopy, may also better inform treatment guidelines. Owing to the current low-quality evidence on which many guidelines are based and the inherent morbidity of pancreas surgery, it is imperative that patients with PCLs are referred to institutions with advanced diagnostics and a multidisciplinary approach to patient surveillance and management.",

Early detection of gastroschisis in utero has become the standard with improved prenatal care and screening. There are multiple surgical management techniques, though sutureless closure is being used more frequently. Postoperative feeding difficulty is common and requires vigilance for complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis. Infants with simple gastroschisis are expected to have eventual catch-up growth and normal development, while those with complex gastroschisis have higher morbidity and mortality. Management requires collaboration amongst several perinatal disciplines, including obstetrics, maternal fetal medicine, neonatology, pediatric surgery, and pediatric gastroenterology for optimal care and long-term outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts uniquely express ERN2/IRE1β, a paralogue of the most evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, ERN1/IRE1α. How ERN2 functions at the host-environment interface and why a second paralogue evolved remain incompletely understood. Using conventionally raised and germ-free Ern2-/- mice, we found that ERN2 was required for microbiota-induced goblet cell maturation and mucus barrier assembly in the colon. This occurred only after colonization of the alimentary tract with normal gut microflora, which induced Ern2 expression. ERN2 acted by splicing Xbp1 mRNA to expand ER function and prevent ER stress in goblet cells. Although ERN1 can also splice Xbp1 mRNA, it did not act redundantly to ERN2 in this context. By regulating assembly of the colon mucus layer, ERN2 further shaped the composition of the gut microbiota. Mice lacking Ern2 had a dysbiotic microbial community that failed to induce goblet cell development and increased susceptibility to colitis when transferred into germ-free WT mice. These results show that ERN2 evolved at mucosal surfaces to mediate crosstalk between gut microbes and the colonic epithelium required for normal homeostasis and host defense.",

        "Abstract": "Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an increasing challenge in managing inflammatory bowel dis- ease patients both medically and surgically. Although several international and national medical/surgical associations published guide- lines in this area, there is still a huge difference between daily practices and these guidelines, especially depending on regional practices and governmental policies. Therefore, we aimed to investigate and define gastroenterologists' and surgeons' fear of COVID-19 and how they have managed inflammatory bowel disease patients during this pandemic in the Black Sea region. A 20-question survey was administered to 70 gastroenterology specialists and 80 general surgeons who are mainly focused on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in 5 countries in the Black Sea region. The majority of respondents (81.3%) mentioned that they have concerns that their inflammatory bowel disease patients were at risk of contracting COVID-19. In addition, the majority of respondents (80.3%) believed that inflammatory bowel disease itself, inde- pendent of medications, might increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. The majority of gastroenterologists told that they did not stop inflammatory bowel disease medications due to the COVID-19 pandemic unless patients had COVID-19 disease. Surgeons overwhelm- ingly reached a consensus on how to test patients for COVID-19 perioperatively and came to a conclusion on which of the patients can- not wait to be operated. Both gastroenterologists and general surgeons, usually have similar perceptions. Despite the increasing number of definitive studies, it seems that there are still regional differences in the perception of COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease patient care during the pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "Deamidated gliadin peptide-IgG (DGP-IgG) antibody serology testing is widely utilised in screening for coeliac disease in Australia; however, it is used sparingly in Europe. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of a positive DGP-IgG in the setting of a negative tissue transglutaminase-IgA (tTG-IgA) for gastrointestinal pathology among paediatric patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children with an elevated DGP-IgG in the setting of a negative tTG-IgA who underwent gastroscopy over a 48-month period (January 2015-December 2018) at a tertiary paediatric centre. They were identified utilising the electronic pathology database and demographic and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patients who had previously been diagnosed with coeliac disease were on a gluten-free diet or over the age of 18 were excluded from the study. Twenty-six patients with an elevated DGP-IgG in the setting of a negative tTG-IgA underwent gastroscopy. Our study yielded a positive predictive value of 1/26 (3.9% CI 95% 0.7%, 18.9%) for the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Overall, there were 25 histopathological diagnoses including 1 diagnosis of coeliac disease among the total 26 patients who were positive DGP-IgG and negative tTG-IgA and underwent gastroscopy. Our findings suggest that an isolated positive DGP-IgG has a very low diagnostic yield for coeliac disease in children and may be indicative of other gastrointestinal pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Optical diagnosis (OD) of polyps can be performed with advanced endoscopic imaging. For high-confidence diagnoses, a \"resect and discard\" strategy could offer significant histopathology time and cost savings. The implementation threshold is a ≥90% OD-histology surveillance interval concordance. Here we assessed the OD learning curve and feasibility of a resect and discard strategy for ≤5-mm and <10-mm polyps in a bowel cancer screening setting. In this prospective feasibility study, 8 bowel cancer screening endoscopists completed a validated OD training module and performed procedures. All <10-mm consecutive polyps had white-light and narrow-band images taken and were given high- or low-confidence diagnoses until 120 high-confidence ≤5-mm polyp diagnoses had been performed. All polyps had standard histology. High-confidence OD errors underwent root-cause analysis. Histology and OD-derived surveillance intervals were calculated. Of 565 invited patients, 525 patients were included. A total of 1560 <10-mm polyps underwent OD and were resected and retrieved (1329 ≤5 mm and 231 6-9 mm). There were no <10-mm polyp cancers. High-confidence OD was accurate in 81.5% of ≤5-mm and 92.8% of 6-9-mm polyps. Sensitivity for OD of a ≤5-mm adenoma was 93.0% with a positive predictive value of 90.8%. OD-histology surveillance interval concordance for ≤5-mm OD was 91.3% (209/229) for U.S. Multi-Society Task Force, 98.3% (225/229) for European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and 98.7% (226/229) for British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, respectively. A resect and discard strategy for high-confidence ≤5-mm polyp OD in a group of bowel cancer screening colonoscopists is feasible and safe, with performance exceeding the 90% surveillance interval concordance required for implementation in clinical practice.

We found <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> strains indigenous in the southernmost islands of Japanese Archipelago, Okinawa, and defined them as hspOkinawa and hpRyukyu. Genome data of the strains revealed that hspOkinawa diverged from other East Asian strains about 20,000 years ago, and that hpRyukyu diverged about 45,000 years ago. The closest strains of hpRyukyu were found from Afghanistan, Punjab, and Nepal, which suggest this strain originated in the central Asia and traveled across the Eurasian continent during Paleolithic era. The divergence date of hpRyukyu corresponds with human fossil records in Okinawa. Although it is controversial from human DNA analyses whether descendants of the Paleolithic migrants remain in the modern Japanese population, this study reveals that the bacterium of Paleolithic origin remains in the stomachs of current Japanese.",

        "Title": "MRI-Based Pancreatic Atrophy Is Associated With Malignancy or Invasive Carcinoma in Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm.",
        "Abstract": "Abrupt change in the caliber of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) with distal pancreatic atrophy (PA) was considered as one of worrisome features in the International Association of Pancreatology guideline and American College of Gastroenterology guideline for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). However, this feature was not included in other guidelines. Moreover, the association between PA alone and malignancy in IPMNs has not been fully evaluated. In the present study, we investigated the role of image-based PA in identifying malignant IPMNs or invasive carcinoma. A total of 186 patients with IPMNs were included for analysis. The tumor size, location, MPD diameter, presence of a mural nodule (MN), and PA were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Demographic information and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were also collected. IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia and associated invasive carcinoma were regarded as malignant IPMNs. PA was observed in 34 cases (18.3%). The occurrence of malignant IPMNs or invasive carcinoma in patients with PA were significantly higher than in those without PA (52.9% vs. 22.3%; 44.1% vs. 8.9%, all P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PA was an independently associated factor for malignant IPMNs [odds ratio (OR) = 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-6.78] or invasive carcinoma (OR = 7.78, 95%CI: 2.62-23.10) after modified with confounders. Subgroup analysis in MPD-involved IPMNs also indicated that PA was an independently associated factor for invasive carcinoma (OR = 9.72, 95%CI: 2.43-38.88). PA had a similar performance with MPD plus MN [the area under the curve (AUC) was both 0.71] in identifying malignancy. PA had a higher performance in identifying invasive carcinoma in MPD-involved IPMNs than MN (AUC = 0.71 vs. 0.65, P = 0.02). Our data showed that imaging-based PA was associated with malignancy or invasive carcinoma regardless of abrupt change in the caliber of MPD in IPMNs. PA had an acceptable performance in identifying malignant IPMNs.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal carcinoma is the third most malignant and second leading cause of death from cancer. The cruelty of this entity is that it takes decades to be symptomatic and is known to be detected late in its timeline by a screening technique. The fatality of this carcinoma only means heightened importance of screening guidelines to be laid down and strict follow-ups by the healthcare providers. A novel method, a potential competitor that could now replace the present screening techniques for colorectal carcinoma, is computed tomographic colonography (CTC) or virtual colonoscopy. Though it first came into existence in 1994, this method is yet to be deeply studied and scrutinized for it to be the next benchmark modality. This review has mainly focused on the various features of CTC. It is contrasted against the gold standard colonoscopy for its superiority, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, patient logistics, and role in detecting extra-colonic lesions. The main focus would be laid on CTC being a screening modality. The review also emphasized why there is a need for the current healthcare providers to incorporate this modality into their practice widely. Although much has been said about CTC and its various aspects of cost-effectiveness, about it being replaced or supplemented for cancer screening, a collaborative effort has to be made by both the fields of radiology and gastroenterology to investigate the outcomes of this not so new technique in daily practice and to avoid misinterpretation of the results due to lack of skill and proficiency.",

We aimed to assess health care professionals' (HCPs) theoretical and applied knowledge of pregnancy-related IBD issues. A cross-sectional international survey was distributed to HCPs providing IBD care between October 2020 and March 2021. Knowledge was assessed using the validated Crohn's and Colitis Pregnancy Knowledge Score (CCPKnow; range, 0-17). Decision-making was assessed by free text responses to 3 clinical scenarios scored against predetermined scoring criteria (maximum score 70). Among 81 participants, median CCPKnow score was 16 (range, 8-17), and median total scenario score was 29 (range, 9-51). Health care professionals who treat >10 IBD patients per week (CCPKnow P = .03; scenarios P = .003) and are more regularly involved in pregnancy care (CCPKnow P = .005; scenarios P = .005) had significantly better scores. Although CCPKnow scoring was consistently high (median score ≥15) across all groups, consultants scored better than trainees and IBD nurses (P = .008 and P = .031). Median scenario scores were higher for consultants (32) and IBD nurses (33) compared with trainees (24; P = .018 and P = .022). There was a significant positive correlation between caring for greater numbers of pregnant IBD patients and higher CCPKnow (P = .001, r = .358) and scenario scores (P = .001, r = .377). There was a modest correlation between CCPKnow and scenario scores (r = .356; P < 0.001). Despite \"good\" theoretical pregnancy-related IBD knowledge as assessed by CCPKnow, applied knowledge in the scenarios was less consistent. There is need for further HCP education and clinical experience to achieve optimal standardized care for IBD in pregnancy.",

This creates stress and anxiety which impact on patients' and/or their partners' quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach to SD is often advisable in these patients. This survey assessed if gastroenterologists routinely discuss SD with their patients and the barriers toward discussing SD in clinical practice. A 29-item questionnaire was sent to members of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and Digestive Endoscopy (SIGE). A descriptive analysis of responses was performed. Out of 714 eligible gastroenterologists, 426 (59.7%), responded.The majority (>70%) never/infrequently investigated SD with their patients and, similarly, most patients never discussed SD during the visit. The most reported reasons were lack of knowledge (58%), time (44%), and embarrassment (30%). However, more than 70% of respondents indicated that all specialists should be able to manage sexual problems, and more than 80% declared that it would be useful for gastroenterologists to attend courses dedicated to the problem of SD. Despite the high prevalence of SD, counselling was not routinely performed in gastroenterological care. Lack of education/knowledge appeared as the most important factor. Most of responders felt that attending a course on SD might increase the awareness of SD.",

        "Abstract": "The role of malnutrition on the prognosis of hospitalized cirrhotic patients is incompletely studied. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of malnutrition, functional scores and their impact on prognosis of hospitalized cirrhotic patients. This retrospective study included all patients with cirrhosis hospitalized in the gastroenterology unit at Saint-Luc university hospital, Brussels between April 2014 and September 2014. Nutritional status was evaluated according to minimum clinical summary diagnostic criteria. Cirrhosis-related complications or death occurrence were analysed in a one-year follow-up. 95 cirrhotic patients were assessed for nutritional status and outcomes. Malnutrition affected 45.3% of patients and was more frequent with the severity of cirrhosis: 29% in Child-Pugh A, 48.8% in Child-Pugh B and 72.2% in Child-Pugh C patients. 58.9% of patients developed cirrhosis-related complications (60.7% in the malnutrition group vs. 39.3%, p<0.001, OR 5.06, IC95 1.90-14.58) and 33.7% of patients died (68.75% vs. 31.25%, p=0.002, OR 4.33, IC95 1.62-12.28). Adjusting for age, sodium, MELD, Charlson index, hepatocellular carcinoma, platelets, diabetes, prognostic nutritional index and Braden scale, malnutrition was significantly associated with higher mortality and morbidity rates with an OR of 3.56 (CI95 1.55-8.16) and 2.09 (CI95 1.16-3.77) respectively. Braden scale was significantly associated with higher mortality (p=0.027, OR 1.25, CI95 1.03-1.52) whereas prognostic nutritional index was associated with higher morbidity (p=0.001, OR 0.94, CI95 0.90-0.98). Malnutrition is highly prevalent in hospitalized cirrhotic patients. Malnutrition, low prognostic nutritional index and low Braden scale are associated with poor outcomes in cirrhosis.",

        "Abstract": "To report which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were associated with gastric or duodenal perforation (GDP) in dogs presented to a university teaching hospital and to report the frequency of prescription of NSAIDs by the corresponding referring veterinary community during the same time period. Retrospective cohort study of dogs from January 2007 to March 2020. Single university teaching hospital. A total of 30 dogs met inclusion criteria. Four dogs were administered more than 1 NSAID within 7 days of GDP, 3 dogs received a combination of an NSAID and a corticosteroid, and 1 dog received 2 NSAIDs and a corticosteroid. Four dogs received an overdose of an NSAID. One dog received an overdose of 1 NSAID and received an additional NSAID at the labeled dose within 7 days of GDP. Eighteen dogs received only 1 NSAID at the labeled dose. In these 18 dogs, meloxicam was administered in 44.4% (8/18), firocoxib in 27.8% (5/18), deracoxib in 16.7% (3/18), and piroxicam in 11.1% (2/18). One hundred and sixty surveys on NSAID prescribing practice were returned. Carprofen was the most commonly prescribed NSAID (70.6%), followed by meloxicam (10.6%), deracoxib (8.4%), firocoxib (7.8%), aspirin (1.5%), and other (0.9%). NSAID administration, even at labeled doses, appears to be a precipitating factor for GDP. Despite carprofen being the most frequently prescribed NSAID over the study period, no case of GDP received it as a single therapeutic agent. Further prospective evaluation is needed to verify these findings.",

        "Abstract": "Excluding oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) from the diet is increasingly being used to treat children with gastrointestinal complaints. The aim of this position paper is to review the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of its use in children and provide expert guidance regarding practical aspects in case its use is considered . Members of the Gastroenterology Committee, the Nutrition Committee and the Allied Health Professionals Committee of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition contributed to this position paper. Clinical questions regarding initiation, introduction, duration, weaning, monitoring, professional guidance, safety and risks of the diet are addressed. A systematic literature search was performed from 2005 to May 2021 using PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In the absence of evidence, recommendations reflect the expert opinion of the authors. The systematic literature search revealed that the low-FODMAP diet has not been comprehensively studied in children. Indications and contraindications of the use of the diet in different pediatric gastroenterological conditions are discussed and practical recommendations are formulated. There is scarce evidence to support the use of a low-FODMAP diet in children with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and no evidence to recommend its use in other gastrointestinal diseases and complaints in children. Awareness of how and when to use the diet is crucial, as a restrictive diet may impact nutritional adequacy and/or promote distorted eating in vulnerable subjects. The present article provides practical safety tips to be applied when the low-FODMAP diet is considered in children.",

        "Abstract": "The Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument was developed to evaluate the quality of clinical practice guidelines. Evidence suggests that development, reporting, and appraisal of guidelines on surgical interventions may be better informed by modification of the instrument. We aimed to develop an AGREE II extension specifically designed for appraisal of guidelines of surgical interventions. In a three-part project funded by the United European Gastroenterology and the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, (i) we identified factors that were associated with higher quality of surgical guidelines, (ii) we statistically calibrated the AGREE II instrument in the context of surgical guidelines using correlation, reliability, and factor analysis, and (iii) we undertook a Delphi consensus process of stakeholders to inform the development of an AGREE II extension instrument for surgical interventions. Several features were prioritized by stakeholders as of particular importance for guidelines of surgical interventions, including development of a guideline protocol, consideration of practice variability and surgical expertise in different settings, and specification of infrastructures required to implement the recommendations. The AGREE-S-AGREE II extension instrument for surgical interventions has 25 items, compared to the 23 items of the original AGREE II instrument, organized into the following 6 domains: Scope and purpose, Stakeholders, Evidence synthesis, Development of recommendations, Editorial independence, and Implementation and update. As the original instrument, it concludes with an overall appraisal of the quality of the guideline and a judgement on whether the guideline is recommended for use. Several items were amended and rearranged among domains, and an item was deleted. The Rigor of Development domain of the original AGREE II was divided into Evidence Synthesis and Development of Recommendations. Items of the AGREE II domain Clarity of Presentation were incorporated in the new domain Development of Recommendations. Three new items were introduced, addressing the development of a guideline protocol, support by a guideline methodologist, and consideration of surgical experience/expertise. The AGREE-S appraisal instrument has been developed to be used for assessment of the methodological and reporting quality of guidelines on surgical interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroendocrine neoplasias comprise a heterogenous group of malignant tumours, mostly arising from the gastro-entero-pancreatic system (GEP). Most of these tumours develop from the small intestine and pancreas and the liver is the predominant site for distant metastases. Patients may be asymptomatic for a long time and liver metastases are frequently diagnosed by chance or during operations for bowel obstruction, for example, during emergency surgery. The only curative therapy consists in complete removal of primary and metastases. In case of metastatic disease, various treatment modalities need to be discussed in interdisciplinary tumour boards comprised of specialists from gastroenterology, (liver-)surgery, radiology, nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, pathology and endocrinology. By combining different therapies, even patients with progressive disease may reach long-term overall survival with good quality of life. The most important factors for decisions on therapy are individual factors like tumour grading, hormonal functionality, type of metastases and evolution of the disease. Adequate treatment of liver metastases comprises various surgical strategies as well as locally ablative radiological interventions and nuclear medical therapies, in complement to systemic treatments.",

        "Abstract": "The development of guidelines by gastroenterology societies increasingly stresses evidence-based endoscopic practice. We performed a systematic assessment to determine whether endoscopic video teaching platforms incorporate evidence-based educational strategies and methods in order to disseminate guideline-based endoscopic management strategies. Platforms with a video component were systematically identified using the Google search engine, Apple and Android application stores, and searching four major gastroenterology society websites and three known platforms, to identify all relevant platforms. Two video samples from each teaching platform were reviewed independently by two authors and assessed for use of a priori defined principles of evidence-based medicine, as determined by consensus agreement and for the use of simulation. Fourteen platforms were included in the final analysis, and two videos from each were analyzed. One of the 14 platforms used simulation and incorporated evidence-based medicine principles consistently. Nine of the 14 platforms were not transparent in regard to citation. None of the platforms consistently cited the certainty of evidence or explained how evidence was selected. Education of guideline-based endoscopic management strategies using principles of evidence-based medicine is under-utilized in endoscopic videos. In addition, the use of cognitive simulation is absent in this arena. There is a paucity of evidence-based cognitive endoscopy simulators designed for fellows that incorporate systematic evaluation, and efforts should be made to create this platform.",

        "Abstract": "Endoscopy remains the exam of choice in the evaluation of activity in Crohn's disease (CD) after surgery (ACD-AS). However, intestinal ultrasound (IUS) may represent a noninvasive alternative. The objective of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of this modality compared to endoscopy. This is a cross-sectional study, comprising a period of 14 months, carried out in patients with established CD and ileocecal resection due to the disease. IUS (HI-VISION Avius®, Tokyo, Japan) was performed with linear probe B-mode/Doppler prior to ileocolonoscopy. IUS and ileocolonoscopy were performed on the same day by 2 specialists in Gastroenterology dedicated to ultrasound and inflammatory bowel disease, in a double-blind mode. Collected demographic and clinical data (Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI]; remission ≤4), serological/fecal inflammatory parameters (leukocytes [4-10 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L], C-reactive protein [≤0.5 mg/dL], and fecal calprotectin [<50 mg/kg]), endoscopy (Rutgeerts score: remission <i2), and ultrasound (intestinal wall thickening [≤3 mm] and digestive wall vascularization using the semiquantitative score of Limberg [absent = 0, sparse = 1, moderate = 2, and marked = 3]). Thirty-nine patients (female: 64.1%, mean age: 43.5 ± 15.3 years) were included. The median post-surgery follow-up was 9 years (IQR 3-12). The Montreal classification was as follows: L1, 61.5% (<i>n</i> = 24); L3, 38.5% (<i>n</i> = 15); B1 and B2, 28.2% (<i>n</i> = 11); and B3, 43.6% (<i>n</i> = 17). Most patients were in clinical remission (87.2%; <i>n</i> = 34), with a mean HBI of 2.1 ± 2.2. Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had normal inflammatory markers. IUS (intestinal wall thickening >3 mm and/or Limberg score >1) was abnormal in 61.5% (<i>n</i> = 24) of the cases. Endoscopic remission (Rutgeerts score <i2) in 53.8% (<i>n</i> = 21) of the cases. Compared to endoscopy, IUS (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.007) showed a diagnostic accuracy superior to that of inflammatory parameters (AUROC = 0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.083) and clinical parameters (AUROC = 0.64, <i>p</i> = 0.139). IUS showed a moderate concordance with endoscopy (κ = 0.5, <i>p</i> = 0.001), which was higher than that with inflammatory parameters (ĸ = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.041) or clinical parameters (ĸ = 0.29, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Ultrasound evaluation of the digestive wall is a noninvasive technique that shows a good diagnostic accuracy and a moderate concordance with endoscopy, being superior to clinical and serological/fecal inflammatory parameters.",

        "Abstract": "There has been a disparity in familiarity regarding the public interest in gastroenterology terminologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to understand the outcomes of the public's view on gastrointestinal topics and their potential social effects. This study is a comparative analysis of American Google Trends gastrointestinal terminology during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a similar time frame (March 2018-February 2020) to determine how trends in the patient-seeking behavior of gastrointestinal terminology changed throughout the pandemic. The analysis discovered a substantial decrease in search volumes of gastrointestinal topics, more significantly in the first pandemic months. Later in the pandemic, search volumes trended toward pre-pandemic years in terms of public interest. In the case of gastrointestinal procedures, endoscopy and colonoscopies, they surpassed pre-pandemic interest levels statistically (p-values of 0.01 and 0.002). The public's decreased interest in gastrointestinal topics at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic may have adverse effects on the healthcare maintenance of patients who could have had a positive outcome in their gastrointestinal health with proper monitoring. Although gastrointestinal internet searches increased toward pre-pandemic levels as the seasons progressed, further research is needed to determine the social impact of decreased public interest.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are distressing chronic diseases associated with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits of unknown aetiology. Results from previous studies indicate that, across both diseases, increased levels of illness-related anxiety and dysfunctional symptom expectations contribute to symptom persistence. Thus, comparing both disorders with regard to common and disease-specific factors in the persistence and modification of gastrointestinal symptoms seems justified. Our primary hypothesis is that persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in UC and IBS can be improved by modifying dysfunctional symptom expectations and illness-related anxiety using expectation management strategies. To assess the extent to which persistent somatic symptoms are modifiable in adult patients with UC and IBS, we will conduct an observer-blinded, three-arm randomised controlled trial. A total of 117 patients with UC and 117 patients with IBS will be randomised into three groups of equal size: targeted expectation management aiming to reduce illness-related anxiety and dysfunctional symptom expectations in addition to standard care (SC, intervention 1), non-specific supportive treatment in addition to SC (intervention 2) or SC only (control). Both active intervention groups will comprise three individual online consultation sessions and a booster session after 3 months. The primary outcome is baseline to postinterventional change in gastrointestinal symptom severity. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Medical Association (2020-10198-BO-ff). The study will shed light onto the efficacy and mechanisms of action of a targeted expectation management intervention for persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with UC and IBS. Furthermore, the detailed analysis of the complex biopsychosocial mechanisms will allow the further advancement of aetiological models and according evidence-based intervention strategies.

        "Abstract": "A 79-year-old woman and a 92-year-old woman were referred to the gastroenterology department for management of persistent colovaginal fistula despite surgical and non-surgical management. Both patients had several hospitalisations for recurrent urinary tract infections. After failed surgical management and endoscopy using over-the-scope clipping, both patients underwent endoscopic closure using the Amplatzer cardiac septal occluder device. Both patients underwent successful closure and had no recurrence of symptoms at 6-month follow-up. Although there are several therapies available for persistent colovaginal fistulas, most involve multiple sessions and have high recurrence rate. There have been reports in the literature of cardiac septal occluders being used in the management of upper gastrointestinal tract fistulas, but few cases exist explaining their role in the management of colovaginal fistulas.

        "Title": "A novel scalable electrode array and system for non-invasively assessing gastric function using flexible electronics.",
        "Abstract": "Disorders of gastric function are highly prevalent, but diagnosis often remains symptom-based and inconclusive. Body surface gastric mapping is an emerging diagnostic solution, but current approaches lack scalability and are cumbersome and clinically impractical. We present a novel scalable system for non-invasively mapping gastric electrophysiology in high-resolution (HR) at the body surface. The system comprises a custom-designed stretchable high-resolution \"peel-and-stick\" sensor array (8 × 8 pre-gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes at 2 cm spacing; area 225 cm<sup>2</sup> ), wearable data logger with custom electronics incorporating bioamplifier chips, accelerometer and Bluetooth synchronized in real-time to an App with cloud connectivity. Automated algorithms filter and extract HR biomarkers including propagation (phase) mapping. The system was tested in a cohort of 24 healthy subjects to define reliability and characterize features of normal gastric activity (30 m fasting, standardized meal, and 4 h postprandial). Gastric mapping was successfully achieved non-invasively in all cases (16 male; 8 female; aged 20-73 years; BMI 24.2 ± 3.5). In all subjects, gastric electrophysiology and meal responses were successfully captured and quantified non-invasively (mean frequency 2.9 ± 0.3 cycles per minute; peak amplitude at mean 60 m postprandially with return to baseline in <4 h). Spatiotemporal mapping showed regular and consistent wave activity of mean direction 182.7° ± 73 (74.7% antegrade, 7.8% retrograde, 17.5% indeterminate). BSGM is a new diagnostic tool for assessing gastric function that is scalable and ready for clinical applications, offering several biomarkers that are improved or new to gastroenterology practice.",

        "Title": "Association of direct oral anticoagulant-proton pump inhibitor cotherapy with adverse outcomes: protocol for a population-based cohort study.",
        "Abstract": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for primary and secondary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, there remains controversy about the overall net clinical benefit of PPIs (omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole) when coprescribed with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban). Our objective is to explore the risk of clinically relevant events, including bleeding, thromboembolic events and death, in patients prescribed DOACs while taking PPIs versus no PPI. The protocol describes a retrospective cohort study of all Ontario residents aged 66 years or older with atrial fibrillation and at least one pharmacy dispensation for a DOAC identified using linked administrative healthcare databases covering 2009-2020. Ontario drug benefit dispensation records will be used to ascertain PPI exposure during DOAC therapy. The primary outcome is a composite of clinically relevant bleeding, thrombotic events or all-cause death. A minimum of 520 patients in total with at least one of the components of the composite outcome are needed. Poisson regression with a generalised estimating equation model will be used to calculate the adjusted incidence rate difference, incidence rate ratios 95% CI, adjusting for propensity for PPI use using inverse probability of treatment weights. This research is exempt from REB review under section 45 of Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act. We will report our findings in a peer-reviewed biomedical journal and present them at conferences. The study will provide useful evidence to optimise the coprescription of DOACs and PPIs in practice.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenesis of gallstones (GS) is multifactorial and is influenced by numerous environmental and genetic risk factors. As a result, clinico-epidemiology and aetiopathogenesis of GS vary in different populations. Understanding the aetiopathogenesis of GS for different populations is imperative in control and prevention of GS disease and its associated complications. This protocol describes the methodology of a scoping review which focuses on synthesising the most updated knowledge on GS disease in South Asia. The scoping review proposed in this protocol will be guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework and the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual. Accordingly, population, concept and context strategy will be used to formulate the scoping review question, eligibility criteria and search strategy. In the search, electronic databases, MEDLINE/PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Cochrane library, CINAHL, Trip, and Google scholar, as well as various grey literature sources will be used in synthesising and presenting the findings on clinico-epidemiology and aetiopathogenesis of GS disease in South Asia. As secondary data will be used in the study, ethical approval will not be required. The scoping review proposed by this protocol will accurately summarise the current knowledge on GS disease in South Asia based on published and unpublished literature on the field. Thus, the evidence presented in the review will be important for healthcare providers to make decisions on the control and prevention of GS disease and as well as to identify future research priorities on GS disease in South Asia.",

        "Abstract": "The exposure of healthcare workers (HCW) to fecal-orally transmitted pathogens like hepatitis E Virus (HEV), <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> or <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is still not known. The potential risk for employees or patients to acquire these infections through asymptomatic infected healthcare personnel has not yet been studied. Physicians and nurses in gastroenterology working in endoscopic workspaces were recruited. Employees from cardiology, presumed to possess a lower exposure, served as controls. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence was analyzed as a control pathogen without fecal-oral route of transmission. This study provides an objective view onto the potential exposure risk for HCW and patients in endoscopic workspaces. We hypothesize that HCW in gastroenterological endoscopy show a higher seroprevalence for fecal-oral pathogens like HEV, <i>C. jejuni</i> and <i>H. pylori</i> compared to HCW in cardiology. Primary objective was the assessment of antibody titers against HEV, <i>C. jejuni</i> and <i>H. pylori</i> in serum of HCW from gastroenterological endoscopy as well as cardiology. As a secondary objective we analyzed the seroprevalence against CMV. 65 HCW were from gastroenterological endoscopy (n=42) and cardiology (n=23) in three medical centers in the German federal states of Brandenburg, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein and were prospectively studied. Antibody titers were determined via ELISA in serum. HCW in gastroenterological endoscopy showed a significantly higher <i>C. jejuni</i> seroprevalence for IgG (19.1 %) compared to HCW from the field of cardiology (8.7 %; p=0.04). IgA titers against <i>C. jejuni</i> were negligible. HEV seroprevalence for IgG did not differ significantly between HCW in gastroenterological endoscopy (7.1 %) and cardiology (8.7 %), respectively. IgA and IgM titers against HEV were also negligible. All other antibody titers against CMV and <i>H. pylori</i> showed no significant difference. Only <i>the C. jejuni</i> seroprevalence was significantly increased in HCW from the field of gastroenterological endoscopy. HEV seroprevalence showed no differences. The results for CMV and <i>H. pylori</i> were without pathological findings. However, there is no elevated risk for HEV exposure in medical staff working at an endoscopy unit, but for <i>C. jejuni</i> the protective measures might need to be improved.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and functional diarrhoea (FDr) are the two major functional bowel disorders characterized by diarrhoea. In spite of their high prevalence, IBS-D and FDr are associated with major uncertainties, especially regarding their optimal diagnostic work-up and management. A Delphi consensus was performed with experts from 10 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 31 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus (defined as >80% agreement) was reached for all the statements. The panel agreed with the potential overlapping of IBS-D and FDr. In terms of diagnosis, the consensus supports a symptom-based approach also with the exclusion of alarm symptoms, recommending the evaluation of full blood count, C-reactive protein, serology for coeliac disease, and faecal calprotectin, and consideration of diagnosing bile acid diarrhoea. Colonoscopy with random biopsies in both the right and left colon is recommended in patients older than 50 years and in presence of alarm features. Regarding treatment, a strong consensus was achieved for the use of a diet low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols, gut-directed psychological therapies, rifaximin, loperamide, and eluxadoline. A weak or conditional recommendation was achieved for antispasmodics, probiotics, tryciclic antidepressants, bile acid sequestrants, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists (i.e. alosetron, ondansetron, or ramosetron). A multinational group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on the definition, diagnosis, and management of IBS-D and FDr.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new idea or field of research. However, recent advancements in computing technology as well as increasing worldwide experience in applying AI to various fields have enabled us to hope that applying it to the medical practice could improve outcomes. The aim of the article was to evaluate potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical practice of gastroenterology. AI algorithms can offer many benefits over the traditional diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic scores, or non-AI enhanced procedures that we perform today. It can very easily process complex mathematical data, which would allow to account for many parameters and with highly sophisticated formulas to determine a conclusion, to a degree that would be impractical or impossible for a human to do alone in the clinical practice. This could allow for significantly more individualized treatments for each patient. As more data becomes available, it can be fed into the algorithm, which allows it to change based on the new data. However, we must be aware that most studies performed today are still early retrospective studies, and their utility still needs to be evaluated in future large scale prospective studies. Apart from the medical challenges, it must be noted that the impact of large-scale implementation of artificial intelligence will have challenges related to ethical and financial aspects as well.",

They were randomly divided into the control group (<i>n</i>=23), oral prednisone acetate group (<i>n</i>=28) and/or combined with local injection Triamcinolone acetonide group (<i>n</i>=30). Analysis the stenosis rates, endoscopic stent dilatation times, the scores of the Atkinson classification and QLQ-OES18 after 12 weeks. Also the expression of carbohydrate sulfotransferase15 (CHST15) mRNA, TGF-β1 and Collagen-Ⅰ protein were compared by real-time PCR or immunohistochemistry. <b>Results:</b> The stenosis rates of the control group, oral prednisone acetate group and/or combined with local injection Triamcinolone acetonide group were 82.6% (19/23), 46.4% (13/28) and 20.0% (6/30) (<i>P</i><0.001); endoscopic stent dilatation times [<i>M</i> (<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>)] in these three groups were 2 (1, 3), 0 (0, 0) and 0 (0, 0) (<i>P</i><0.001). After ESD, the scores of the Atkinson classification and QLQ-OES18 in the three groups were lower than before (<i>P</i><0.001); and the expression of CHST15 mRNA in the three groups were 4.31±0.13, 3.44±0.07 and 2.84±0.21 respectively (<i>P</i><0.001). Compared with the control group, the expression of CHST15 mRNA in oral prednisone acetate group was down-regulated (<i>P</i><0.001), and was the lowest in oral prednisone acetate combined with local injection Triamcinolone acetonide group (<i>P</i><0.001). As CHST15 mRNA was down-regulated, the expression of TGF-β1 and Collagen-I protein was also down-regulated (<i>P</i><0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Oral prednisone alone or combined with local injection of triamcinolone acetonide both can prevent esophageal stenosis effectively. Oral combined with local injection of glucocorticoid is particularly more effective. Glucocorticoid can reduce the expression of CHST15 mRNA, thereby inhibiting the expression of TGF-β1 and Collagen-I protein.",

        "Abstract": "Chromosome abnormalities have certain impacts on the disease mechanism in patients with gastrointestinal Behçet's disease-like syndrome (GIBS) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of patients with GIBS-MDS and the potential role(s) played by trisomy 8 from a gastroenterology perspective. A retrospective cohort of 18 patients with GIBS-MDS in China was analysed, and 97 reported cases with individual data from the literature were reviewed in total. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis was performed on the influencing factors of OS. Of the 115 patients included in the study, with a majority from East Asia (92.2%), there were 66 (57.4%) female patients and 76 (66.7%) patients with GIBS onset before MDS, and the ileocecum (45, 48.9%) was the most common location of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement. In addition, 91 (79.1%) patients had the chromosome abnormality of trisomy 8, and 32 (33.7%) patients died. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that a region of origin of East Asia (HR [hazard ratio]: 0.36, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.14 to 0.96, p = 0.041) rather than trisomy 8 (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.68, p = 0.428) was identified as an independent protective factor for survival. Compared to patients without trisomy 8, GIBS-MDS patients with trisomy 8 showed unique clinical characteristics but an unfavorable OS. The region of origin rather than trisomy 8 syndrome played a more important role in the prognosis of GIBS-MDS patients.",

        "Title": "Artificial intelligence in gastroenterology and hepatology: how to advance clinical practice while ensuring health equity.",
        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly used in medicine to improve clinical decision-making and healthcare delivery. In gastroenterology and hepatology, studies have explored a myriad of opportunities for AI/ML applications which are already making the transition to bedside. Despite these advances, there is a risk that biases and health inequities can be introduced or exacerbated by these technologies. If unrecognised, these technologies could generate or worsen systematic racial, ethnic and sex disparities when deployed on a large scale. There are several mechanisms through which AI/ML could contribute to health inequities in gastroenterology and hepatology, including diagnosis of oesophageal cancer, management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver transplantation, colorectal cancer screening and many others. This review adapts a framework for ethical AI/ML development and application to gastroenterology and hepatology such that clinical practice is advanced while minimising bias and optimising health equity.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an abnormal immune response to healthy gut bacteria. When a person develops IBD, their susceptibility to anxiety and/or depression increases. The ACTforIBD programme, specifically designed for people with IBD and comorbid psychological distress, draws on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), which promotes acceptance of situations that cannot be solved such as persistent physical symptoms. There are no ACT trials for IBD using an active control group or a telemedicine approach, which is important to improve accessibility, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The ACTforIBD programme is administered online with a 4-hour therapist involvement per participant only; if successful it can be widely implemented to improve the well-being of many individuals with IBD. Our team have codesigned with consumers the ACTforIBD programme, an 8-week intervention of 1-hour sessions, with the first three sessions and the last session delivered one-to-one by a psychologist, and the other sessions self-directed online. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of ACTforIBD to reduce psychological distress in patients with IBD. Using a randomised controlled trial, 25 participants will be randomised to ACTforIBD, and 25 patients to an active control condition. This protocol has been approved by Deakin University Research Ethics Committee in September 2021 (Ref. 2021-263) and the New Zealand Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee in December 2021 (Ref. 2021 EXP 11384). The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with various stakeholders, including community members, policy-makers and researchers, through local and international conferences.

        "Abstract": "Accessibility of full dose daily of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is limited in Madagascar with an estimated cost well above the purchasing power of Malagasy population. The study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of low-dose tenofovir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This prospective cohort study from January 2018 to December 2020 was conducted in the Department of Hepato-Gastroenterology, University Hospital Joseph Raseta Befelatanana, Antananarivo, Madagascar. The patients enrolled in the study received low dose of TDF 900 mg/week (300 mg daily, three days per week). A total of 45 patients (male/female: 31/14) were included. The mean age was 45.1 ± 11.5 years. Fifteen patients were nucleos(t)ide (NA)-naïve, and 30 patients had prior NA therapy (NA-experienced). Thirty patients were HBeAg positive. A complete virological response (CVR) was achieved in 36/45 patients (80%) at 3 months, 41/45 (91.1%) at 6 months, and 43/45 (95.6%) at 12 months. High viral load at baseline was negative predictive factor of CVR at 3 months (HR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.022-0.92; <i>p</i>: 0.041). There was no significant difference in response between HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, NA-naïve and NA-experienced patients, and cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. Low dose of tenofovir was well tolerated. Ten patients (22.22%) had mild side effects. Mild renal failure was observed in 3 patients (6.7%) during follow-up. Low dose of tenofovir is effective, safe, and well tolerated in a Malagasy population sample. These results still require verification in a large population.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge of the extent of variation in outcome assessment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in routine practice is limited. We aimed to describe and quantify variation in outcome coverage and to explore patient, clinician and practitioner factors associated with it. Prospective exploratory mixed-methods study. IBD clinics at six hospitals in North West England with differing electronic health record (EHR) systems. Mixed-methods study comprising: (a) structured observations of outcomes elicited during consultations (102 patients consulting 24 clinicians); (b) retrospective analysis of outcomes recorded in the EHR (909 consultations; 127 clinicians) and (c) semistructured interviews with the 24 observed clinicians. We determined whether specific outcome 'sets' were elicited or recorded, including: (1) a minimum set of symptom pairs ('PRO-2'); (2) symptom sets from disease activity indices and (3) a reference list of 37 symptoms, signs and impacts. Factors associated with variation were explored in univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses and from clinician interviews. PRO-2 coverage was not invariable (elicited during 81% of observed consultations; recorded in 56% of EHR) and infrequent for complete activity indices (all domains from Harvey-Bradshaw Index: elicited, 18%; recorded, 5%). The median number of outcomes from the reference list elicited per consultation was 12 (13-fold variation) and recorded in EHR was 7 (>20-fold variation). Symptom quantification (PRO-2) seldom adhered closely to standardised descriptors and an explicit timeframe was defined rarely. PRO-2 recording in EHR was associated with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (OR: 2.09 (95% CI 1.15 to 3.80)) and nurse-led consultations (OR: 6.98 (95% CI 3.28 to 14.83)) and a three-way model suggested 26% of total variability lay between clinicians, 17% between patients but the remainder was unexplained. Most clinicians expressed preference for individualised health status evaluations versus standardised outcome assessments. There was little evidence for standardised assessment and recording of IBD outcomes and substantial intra-clinician and inter-clinician variation from one consultation to another. Nurses demonstrated a greater tendency to standardised practice.",

        "Abstract": "Intussusception is an extraordinary cause of acute abdomen in adults and has been defined as the telescoping of a bowel segment into the lumen of an adjacent segment. A 43-year-old female presented to our hospital's emergency department (ED) with 10+ episodes of bloody diarrhea per day, left-sided abdominal pain, and the inability to tolerate oral intake for one month. She was initially diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) ten years ago and is currently on mesalamine oral and enema therapy. She presented to our gastroenterology clinic two weeks after the beginning of her flare and was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. This did not improve her symptoms, and she presented to the ED two weeks later. She underwent a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis which revealed intussusception in the left hemiabdomen with no definite lead point measuring 5.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension with pneumatosis and no evidence of bowel obstruction. There were no other significant laboratory abnormalities. Acute care surgery was consulted and suggested obtaining a CT enterography for further evaluation which showed spontaneous resolution of intussusception with no evidence of pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or intraperitoneal free air. She reports that following oral contrast intake, she \"felt movement and relaxation\" in her abdomen with substantial pain relief. Infectious workup was negative, and therapy was initiated with intravenous steroids. In conclusion, intussusception has been very rarely reported in patients with UC with the most common treatment being surgical resection. However, conservative management in the absence of bowel obstruction can be attempted.",

        "Title": "Imaging-guided interventions modulating portal venous flow: Evidence and controversies.",
        "Abstract": "Portal hypertension is defined by an increase in the portosystemic venous gradient. In most cases, increased resistance to portal blood flow is the initial cause of elevated portal pressure. More than 90% of cases of portal hypertension are estimated to be due to advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, a non-pharmacological treatment for portal hypertension, involve the placement of a stent between the portal vein and the hepatic vein or inferior vena cava which helps bypass hepatic resistance. Portal hypertension may also be a result of extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis or compression. In these cases, percutaneous portal vein recanalisation restores portal trunk patency, thus preventing portal hypertension-related complications. Any portal blood flow impairment leads to progressive parenchymal atrophy and triggers hepatic regeneration in preserved areas. This provides the rationale for using portal vein embolisation to modulate hepatic volume in preparation for extended hepatic resection. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the rationale for, and outcomes associated with, the main imaging-guided interventions targeting the portal vein, as well as to discuss the main controversies around such approaches.",

This was a prospective study carried out in department of Gastroenterology, Sir Ganga Ram hospital, New Delhi. A total of 104 patients with liver cirrhosis were included. Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed on basis of clinical, biochemical, and imaging features. CCM was defined based on echocardiography. Dobutamine stress echocardiography and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) were performed in patients who gave consent. HRS was defined as per standard criteria. Patients with CCM were followed for development of HRS. Fifty (48%) patients were diagnosed with CCM. All patients had diastolic dysfunction, and none had systolic dysfunction. Median age of patients with CCM was significantly higher (59 [31-78 y] vs. 52 [24-70 y], <i>P</i> < 0.05). Severity of liver disease (Child Turcotte Pugh score and model for end-stage liver disease score) and portal pressures (HVPG) did not differ in patients with or without CCM. Patients with CCM did not have increased incidence of HRS at the end of 6-month follow-up study. The presence of CCM was not related with the severity of liver dysfunction or portal pressures. Age was a significant determinant of CCM. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction does not influence the occurrence of HRS.",

        "Abstract": "Introduction Pancreatic trauma is rare and is usually associated with adjacent organ and vascular injuries, which adds to the high morbidity and mortality. In the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) pancreatic trauma (PT) grading system, the higher grades are a composite of less and more severe extents of injuries. We hereby present an observational study of PT with management based on an indigenous algorithmic approach. Our protocol incorporating both the extent of disruption of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and its amenability to interventions (endoscopic, radiological, or surgical) is pragmatic. Methods Ours is a retrospective observational study of 28 consecutive cases of PT, done over a three-year period in an academic institution, by an expert Surgical Gastroenterology unit. All patients diagnosed with PT on a contrast abdominal CT scan were included. After stabilization, they were stratified and managed according to an indigenous protocol. The primary outcome measure was treatment success in terms of recovery. The secondary outcome measure was morbidity of any form. Results One patient with Grade 1 PT was operated on for associated hollow viscus injury. Two patients with AAST Grade 2 and two patients with AAST Grade 3 injury were managed successfully without surgery. Twelve of 21 patients with Grade 3 PT underwent Kimura's splenic vessel preserving distal pancreatectomy. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and central pancreatectomy with Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) was done for 7/21 and 2/21 patients, respectively, with Grade 3 PT. Two with Grade 5 injury underwent trauma Whipple. The overall mortality and morbidity rates in our series were 15.7% and 64%, respectively. Conclusion The pathogenesis in PT is a dynamic process and shows temporal evolution. These patients require serial and periodical clinical and radiological monitoring, especially in those managed conservatively initially. PT can be low or high grade. Patients with isolated low-grade PT can be managed according to the standard step-up approach for acute pancreatitis. A carefully selected subgroup of patients with partial MPD disruption either in the head or body of the pancreas can be managed by endotherapy. Complete distal parenchymal transections require early surgery tailored to individual patients in the form of either splenic vessel preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP) or distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (DP+S). Damage control surgery is the dictum in unstable patients with Grades 4 and 5 injuries not responding to resuscitative measures. A trauma Whipple can be done in a carefully selected subgroup of stable patients with proximal massive disruptions in an experienced hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) unit.",

        "Abstract": "Neurogastroenterology and motility is a rapidly evolving subspecialty that encompasses over 33% of gastroenterological disorders, and up to 50% of referrals to gastroenterology practice. It includes common problems such as dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic constipation, gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, gas/bloating, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, food intolerance and fecal incontinence Standard diagnostic tests such as endoscopy or imaging are normal in these conditions. To define the underlying mechanism(s)/etiology of these disorders, diagnostic motility tests are often required. These are best performed by well-trained personnel in a dedicated motility laboratory. Our purpose is to provide an up-to-date overview on how to organize and develop a motility laboratory based on our collective experiences in setting up such facilities in academia and community practice. A lack of knowledge, training and facilities for providing diagnostic motility tests has led to suboptimal patient care. A motility laboratory is the hub for diagnostic and therapeutic motility procedures. Common procedures include esophageal function tests such as esophageal manometry and pH monitoring, anorectal function tests suchlike anorectal manometry, neurophysiology and balloon expulsion, dysbiosis and food intolerance tests such as hydrogen/methane breath tests, and gastrointestinal transit assessment. These tests provide an accurate diagnosis and guide clinical management including use of medications, biofeedback therapy, neuromodulation, behavioral therapies, evidence-based dietary interventions and endoscopic or surgical procedures. Further, there have been recent developments in billing and coding of motility procedures and training requirements that are not well known. This review provides a stepwise approach on how to set-up a motility laboratory in the community or academic practice and includes the rationale, infrastructure, staffing needs, commonly performed motility tests and their clinical utility, billing and coding strategies, training needs and economic considerations for setting up this service.",

We hypothesized that a clinical decision-making tool would support primary care providers to manage pediatric constipation, improve workflow, and prevent unnecessary subspecialty care. In this pilot quality improvement initiative, a multidisciplinary team completed a root cause analysis related to challenges with the care of pediatric constipation. The results informed the development of interventions including a Clinical Decision Support tool and patient educational materials embedded within an existing order-set in the electronic health record, which we implemented in our primary care network. The use of the updated order-set continues to increase monthly, and there is reported improved workflow and increased confidence by providers. These interventions demonstrated that it is feasible to implement tools to support primary care clinicians in their management of pediatric patients with constipation.",

Developing therapeutic endoscopic robotic platforms now offer operators improved ergonomics, visualization, dexterity, precision, and control and the possibility of increasing proficiency and standardization of complex endoscopic procedures including endoscopic submucosal dissection, endoscopic full-thickness resection, and endoscopic suturing. The following review discusses the history, potential applications, and tools currently available and in development for robotics in therapeutic endoscopy.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the risk factors and construct a prediction model of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) patients with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia. The clinical data of 450 patients with CAG who were diagnosed and treated in the Department of Gastroenterology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from June 2016 to February 2022 were collected. Single and multiple factors logistic regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors of intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia in patients of training cohort. Then, we constructed a model to predict the onset of intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia based on the data of training cohort, following which we tested the model in an external validation cohort of 193 patients from a local university teaching hospital. The ROC curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction model. <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>, HP) infection, pepsinogen I, gastrin-17, and the number of lesions were found to be independent rick factors of the model. The liner prediction model showed excellent predictive value in both training cohort and validation cohort. HP infection, pepsinogen I, gastrin-17, and the number of lesions are independent risk factors for intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia in patients with CAG. The prediction model constructed based on these factors has a high accuracy and excellent calibration, which can provide a great basis for condition assessment and individualized treatment of the patients.",

        "Abstract": "The <i>IDUA</i> gene (MIM 252800) provides instructions for producing alpha-L-iduronidase, which is essential for the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Mutations in the <i>IDUA</i> gene have been found to cause Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) (MIM 607014). This leads to the accumulation of GAGs within lysosomes causing many different organs and tissues to be dysfunctional. Deleted <i>IDUA</i> gene has not been reported in the literature, which showed to be associated with a severe phenotype in our proband case. We report a child from a consanguineous family who presented with severe cardiogenic shock attributed to dilated cardiomyopathy. He was also found to have hepatosplenomegaly, joint stiffness, hearing loss, corneal hazing, facial dysmorphism, and dilation of brain ventricles. Lysosomal storage disease particularly MPS I was suspected though it is considered to be an early atypical presentation. The diagnosis was achieved via gene mutation analysis which showed homozygous <i>IDUA</i> deletion of exon 9' to 3' in combination with a severe deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme. A variant in the form of <i>IDUA</i> gene deletion may indicate an early severe phenotypic presentation of MPS I. Establishment of the diagnosis permits genetic counseling, prevents patients from undergoing unhelpful diagnostic procedures, and allows for accurate prognosis.",

The data on the pediatric endoscopy experience during the COVID-19 pandemic is scarce. Our research goal is to explore the influence of the pandemic on our endoscopy practice. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of pediatric patients ages 1 to 21 years during the first year of the pandemic and compared it to the previous year. We found that procedural volumes were only impacted in the first 2 months of the pandemic and then returned to normal monthly procedural volumes. We also surveyed personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements and pre-procedural screening protocols. One percent of all pediatric endoscopy patients tested positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic year. We demonstrate that the combination of pre-procedural testing and infection control precautions enabled pediatric endoscopies to be performed safely in children.",

        "Title": "Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors With Dexamethasone in Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia: Contributions to Long-Term Polypharmacy.",
        "Abstract": "Introduction  Proton pump inhibitors have been used in conjunction with dexamethasone to treat patients with COVID-19. This is given prophylactically to anticipate possible complications while on steroids, including abdominal pain, gastric ulcers, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors have complications, including <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection, pneumonia, osteoporosis, and vitamin deficiency. The goal of the following project is to assess if there are any subjective and objective benefits to be treated with this regimen instead of dexamethasone on its own. Another inquiry that will be investigated is if this combination results in more patients being prescribed a proton pump inhibitor on discharge.  Materials and methods The following is a retrospective study involving two groups, the first group taking the aforementioned regimen and the second group on dexamethasone only. Objective findings that will be compared include the change in hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels from admission to discharge between the two groups. Subjective findings include complaints of abdominal pain and reported bloody bowel movements. Medication reconciliation on discharge will also be assessed to observe if patients were discharged with a proton pump inhibitor and how long were they taking this medication as an outpatient.  Results The difference between hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine between the two groups was not significant as the p-values were .14, .43. and .10, respectively. Therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted that there was no difference in these objective findings between the two populations. In addition, neither set had complaints of abdominal pain. For the investigated population on a proton pump inhibitor, it was found that 53% of these patients were discharged with this medication. This subset was on this medication for an average of three months, with the maximum duration being seven months for one patient. The data supported the hypothesis that there was no subjective or objective benefit to being on this drug combination, and consequentially, most patients continue to take this medication for months after discharge.  Conclusion The data affirms the hypothesis that most patients can tolerate dexamethasone without the need for a proton pump inhibitor. This study was limited to patients without any history of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding; a separate study would need to be done to investigate the need for prophylaxis for patients with these comorbidities. The concerning finding was that patients are being discharged with a medication that they do not need, some patients are taking proton pump inhibitors for more than half the year. There should be further screening to determine if a patient needs to be on a proton pump inhibitor other than steroids.",

        "Abstract": "Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) is characterized by the growth of multiple discrete small submucosal nodules specifically confined to the lamina propria and superficial submucosa layers of the intestinal wall. Gastric and rectal involvement of NLH is exceedingly rare. To date, few case reports have described diffuse NLH presenting with multiple submucosal lymphomatous polyposis occurring in the rectum.  Our patient is a 39-year-old morbidly obese Hispanic female who presented to the gastroenterology clinic complaining of intermittent hematochezia for the past six months. Colonoscopy showed diffuse nodularity in the sigmoid colon and rectal mucosa, extending 20 cm from the rectal verge. Rectal biopsies revealed moderate active chronic inflammation predominantly of lymphoplasmacytic cells with areas of lymphoid hyperplasia and focal surface ulceration. Immunohistochemistry stains revealed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH).  The NLH is a risk factor for extraintestinal and intestinal lymphomas. When encountering lymphoid hyperplasias, the possibility of malignancy must always be considered. It is crucial to monitor patients with NLH via capsule endoscopies, small bowel series, and colonoscopy for surveillance of new lesions in light of the potential for malignancy.",

        "Abstract": "Telehealth may be a successful strategy to increase access to specialty care for liver disease, but whether the areas with low access to care and a high burden of liver-related mortality have the necessary technology access to support a video-based telehealth strategy to expand access to care is unknown. Access to liver disease specialty care was defined at the county level as <160.9 km (100 miles) from a liver transplant (LT) center or presence of local gastroenterology (GI). Liver-related mortality rates were compared by access to care, and access to technology was compared by degree of access to care and burden of liver-related mortality. Counties with low access to liver disease specialty care had higher rates of mortality from liver disease, and this was highest in areas both >160.9 km from an LT center and without local GI. These counties were more rural, had higher poverty, and had decreased access to devices and internet at broadband speeds. Technology access was lowest in areas with low access to care and the highest burden of liver-related mortality. Areas with poor access to liver disease specialty care have a greater burden of liver-related mortality, and many of their residents lack access to technology. Therefore, a telehealth strategy based solely on patient device ownership and internet access will exclude a large proportion of individuals in the areas of highest need. Further work should be done at the local and state levels to design optimal strategies to reach their populations of need.",

        "Abstract": "Health-disease processes are established and programmed in the first 1500 days of life, a period in which nutrition and the microbiota play a fundamental role. Feeding practices vary, according to regional sociocultural characteristics. The Early Nutrition Group of the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (LASPGHAN) established the goal of identifying the main feeding practices in the first 1500 days that were recommended by health professionals in Latin America. A survey was conducted on the aspects of maternal-infant and young child nutrition during the first 1500 days of life. An open invitation was extended to Latin American healthcare professionals to anonymously answer the online survey. A total of 1284 surveys from participants in 18 Latin American countries were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 37.14 ± 11.1 years, 75.7% were women, 64.7% were physicians, and the rest were nutritionists/nutriologists. A total of 71.4% were familiar with the concept of the first 1000 days of life, 95% answered that exclusive breastfeeding should be carried out up to 6 months of age, and 34.3% responded that complementary feeding should be begun between 4 and 6 months of age. There was scant knowledge regarding nutrition in the pregnant woman. Adherence to traditional complementary feeding practices was evident. In a group of Latin American healthcare professionals, knowledge about nutrition in the first 1000-1500 days of life of an individual is still incomplete and insufficient, showing the need for continued training of healthcare professionals, with respect to those themes.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer ranks third for both men and women as the most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening allows for removal of polyps before they turn to cancer or by identifying early-stage colorectal cancers, which are most treatable. The American College of Gastroenterology recently released an update of their 2009 recommendations, which includes average risk individuals between ages 45 and 49 years due to the increased incidence of early-onset colorectal cancers. They consider screening two types of screening options: (1) one-step colonoscopy, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic and (2) two-step options, all of which require a follow-up colonoscopy when the first step is positive. They added the recommendation of daily aspirin for some people aged 50 to 69 years. However, the recommendations for screening remain the same when people do take aspirin. They recommend endoscopists measure cecal intubation rates, adenoma detection rates, and withdrawal times to reduce postcolonoscopy cancers due to missed lesions. They also propose strategies to promote screening adherence and suggest health systems adopt them. These are important updates of which the gastroenterology nurse should be aware and assist with their implementation.",

The diagnosis of celiac disease generates concern in the patient and limits the quality of life, and adherence to treatment determines symptomatic improvement. For this reason, a nursing consultation for health and nutritional education for celiac patients has been set up in our hospital. The objectives were to know the degree of patient´s satisfaction of this health program regarding technical and communicative aspects, as well as to assess the influence of adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) on health through clinical and analytical parameters. This is a descriptive cross-sectional observational study in patients diagnosed of celiac disease from January 2019 to June 2021 according to the Catassi criteria and who have attended the nursing consultation. Subsequently, the satisfaction survey was carried out and the clinical and analytical results were analyzed descriptively and statistically using the Student's t-test. The satisfaction of the nursing consultation was higher than 90%, highlighting aspects such as the clarity of the information, the interest and the kindness of the healthcare professionals. About 94.5% of the patients showed clinical improvement after the health education and the levels of hemoglobin, ferritin and vitamin B12 increased significantly in the analytical control after the GFD.",

In Italy, teduglutide (Ted), an analogue of GLP-2, was approved in January 2021 by the Italian Regulatory Agency for Drugs (AIFA) for IF-SBS patients ≥1 year old. According to the Agency indications, Ted can now be prescribed by regional reference centers, with costs fully charged to the National Health Service. Following pediatric-use approval in our country and in light of scarce evidence in childhood, the pediatric network for IF of the Italian Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SIGENP) planned to share management methods of Ted in pediatric IF. The main purpose was to identify the best candidates from a cost-effective perspective. Thus, focusing on available literature and on expert opinions, the present position statement provides consensus-based recommendations on the use of Ted for pediatric gastroenterologists and nutritionists treating children with SBS.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a variety of extraintestinal manifestations including arterial and venous thromboembolism. Research evidences that IBD patients have about a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism when compared with the general population. We intended to evaluate the coagulation parameters and the prevalence of thromboembolic events (TE) in IBD patients. It was also our aim to investigate the correlation between coagulation parameters and disease phenotype and activity in this population. This single center prospective observational study was performed between November 2016 and April 2020. The cohort included patients with 18 years of age or older, diagnosed with IBD and followed at a gastroenterology consultation, during a follow-up period of 36 months. Patients were evaluated in terms of IBD type, extent and disease behavior, clinical scores of IBD activity, medication, smoking history, family and personal history of TE, coagulation parameters, fecal calprotectin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hospitalization due to TE, IBD-related hospitalization or surgery, pregnancy, or diagnosis of malignancy. The study included 149 IBD patients (67 males and 82 females). Coagulation parameters were similar in CD and UC patients and only plasminogen was increased in CD patients [97.4 (17.0) <i>versus</i> 91.6 (13.3), <i>p</i> = 0.035], when comparing with UC patients. The determined values were in the range of the reference values described in literature for the standard population. During the follow-up period, none of the patients experienced a TE that demanded hospitalization. In our study, acquired and inherited risk factors for TE and changes in coagulation parameters did not show to influence prothrombotic predisposition in IBD patients. As such, the clinical relevance of measuring coagulation parameters in this population is questionable. NCT05162339 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID).",

        "Abstract": "The description of the clinical presentation of celiac disease (CeD) has usually come from studies at referral centers. Data about CeD presentation in the community are sparse. We aim to describe the clinical presentation of patients with biopsy-proven CeD at a community-based adult gastroenterology practice and compare it to a referral center. We performed a retrospective study of two cohorts of patients diagnosed with CeD between 2000-2007 (n = 117) and 2013-2016 (n = 91) in a community practice, and a third cohort (n = 188) diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 in a tertiary referral center. The clinical presentation, body mass index, tissue-transglutaminase levels, DEXA scan, vitamin D levels, and vaccine recommendations were assessed. Celiac disease presentation changed over time in the two community cohorts. Recently, fewer patients presented with diarrhea and anemia, but constipation and neurologic symptoms were more common. The most recent cohort had a higher proportion of patients who were overweight or obese than the first cohort. However, the body mass index in both community cohorts was higher than in the tertiary referral center. The frequency of osteopenia and osteoporosis was high in both community cohorts. The tertiary referral center patients were younger, presented with a higher proportion of diarrhea and a lower body mass index. The clinical presentation of CeD differs between the community setting and a tertiary referral center. Patients with CeD presenting to the community setting tended to be older, overweight, and to have a high proportion of mineral bone disease.",

        "Abstract": "Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibroinflammatory immune-mediated condition which can affect multiple organ systems and form mass-like lesions. Initial presentation can mimic other diseases such as pancreatic malignancy when there is pancreatic involvement or tuberculosis (TB) when there are pulmonary lesions or hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP). Here, we report a novel case of IgG4-RD presenting as bilateral subdural haematomas with additional findings. Our patient is a male who presented with headaches and blurred vision. Physical examination showed disconjugate gaze with a fixed pupil. Trauma survey radiologic imaging revealed a pancreatic mass concerning for malignancy. Subsequent workup found hypophysitis with optic chiasm compression and hypopituitarism, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and HP. Laboratory values showed an elevated serum IgG4 level and latent TB. Our case adds to the existing IgG4-RD literature by highlighting a unique presentation. It is important to maintain it on the differential diagnosis especially in multisystemic presentations with competing diagnoses.",

Our study describes risk factors and consequences of injury by comparing provider-specific anthropometric and objective procedural data to self-reported injury patterns. A validated MSK symptom survey was sent to gastroenterologists to gauge prevalence, distribution, and severity of active injury. Respondents' procedural activities over 7 years were collected via an endoscopic database. 64 surveys were completed. 54 respondents had active pain; 53.1% reported activity-limiting injury. Activity-limiting injuries lead to longer colonoscopy times (25.3 vs. 22.1 min, P = 0.03) and lower procedural volumes (532 vs. 807, P = 0.01). Hand/wrist injuries yielded longer colonoscopy insertion times (9.35 vs. 8.21 min, P = 0.03) and less hands-on scope hours (81.2 vs. 111.7 h, P = 0.04). Higher esophagogastroduodenoscopy volume corelated with shoulder injury (336.5 vs. 243.1 EGDs/year, P = 0.04). Females had more foot injuries (P = 0.04). Activity-limiting MSK symptoms/injuries affect over 50% of endoscopists with negative impact on procedural volume and efficiency.",

Our objective was to determine the prevalence of suspected CAN in children with FC as compared with their healthy peers. A case-control study was carried out in children aged 3-10 years. Children with FC were recruited at a tertiary outpatient clinic, and healthy controls were recruited at schools. Parents were asked to fill out questionnaires about the history and behaviour of their child, children were inquired using a semistructured interview about experienced traumatic events and sexual knowledge. The interview was scored by two independent observers. The prevalence of suspected CAN was determined according to the questionnaires and interview. In total, 228 children with FC and 153 healthy controls were included. Both groups were age and gender comparable (50% females, median age 6 years (not significant)). No significant difference in the prevalence of suspected CAN was found between children with FC and healthy controls (23.3% vs 30.1%, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.12, p=0.14), including a suspicion of sexual, emotional and physical abuse. Suspected CAN was detected in both children with FC as in healthy controls. The possible association between CAN and FC in children could not be confirmed.",

        "Abstract": "Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare but life-threatening cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Only a handful of cases of successful management of AEF caused by esophageal cancer have been reported. The purpose of this study is to report a case of AEF managed by endovascular aortic repair and review the relevant literature. A 66-year-old man with upper gastroenterology bleeding presented at the Emergency Department of our hospital complaining of chest pain, fever and hematemesis for 6 h. He had vomited 400 mL of bright-red blood and experienced severe chest pain 6 h prior. He had a past medical history of advanced esophageal cancer. He received chemoradiotherapy but stopped 8 mo prior because of intolerance. A chest contrast computed tomographic scan revealed communication between the esophagus and the descending aorta as well as a descending aortic pseudoaneurysm. According to the symptoms and imaging findings, AEF was our primary consideration. The patient underwent aortic angiography, which indicated AEF and descending aortic pseudoaneurysm. Emergency percutaneous thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of the descending aorta was performed, and bleeding was controlled after TEVAR. He received antibiotics and was discharged after treatment. However, he died 2 mo after the TEVAR due to cancer progression. Although AEF is a lethal condition, timely diagnosis and TEVAR may successfully control bleeding.",

Although there are a myriad of applications of AI ranging from identification of bleeding to predicting outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a great deal of research has focused on the identification and classification of gastrointestinal malignancies. Several of the initial randomized, prospective trials utilizing AI in clinical medicine have centered on polyp detection during screening colonoscopy. In addition to work focused on colorectal cancer, AI systems have also been applied to gastric, esophageal, pancreatic, and liver cancers. Despite promising results in initial studies, the generalizability of most of these AI systems have not yet been evaluated.

        "Title": "Impact of liver cirrhosis on ST-elevation myocardial infarction related shock and interventional management, a nationwide analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Critical care is rapidly evolving with significant innovations to decrease hospital stays and costs. To our knowledge, there is limited data on factors that affect the length of stay and hospital charges in cirrhotic patients who present with ST-elevation myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (SRCS). To identify the factors that increase inpatient mortality, length of stay, and total hospital charges in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) compared to those without LC. This study includes all adults over 18 from the National Inpatient Sample 2017 database. The study consists of two groups of patients, including SRCS with LC and without LC. Inpatient mortality, length of stay, and total hospital charges are the primary outcomes between the two groups. We used STATA 16 to perform statistical analysis. The Pearson's chi-square test compares the categorical variables. Propensity-matched scoring with univariate and multivariate logistic regression generated the odds ratios for inpatient mortality, length of stay, and resource utilization. This study includes a total of 35798453 weighted hospitalized patients from the 2017 National Inpatient Sample. The two groups are SRCS without LC (<i>n</i> = 758809) and SRCS with LC (<i>n</i> = 11920). The majority of patients were Caucasian in both groups (67% <i>vs</i> 72%). The mean number of patients insured with Medicare was lower in the LC group (60% <i>vs</i> 56%) compared to the other group, and those who had at least three or more comorbidities (53% <i>vs</i> 90%) were significantly higher in the LC group compared to the non-LC group. Inpatient mortality was also considerably higher in the LC group (28.7% <i>vs</i> 10.63%). Length of Stay (LOS) is longer in the LC group compared to the non-LC group (9 <i>vs</i> 5.6). Similarly, total hospital charges are higher in patients with LC ($147407.80 <i>vs</i> $113069.10, <i>P</i> ≤ 0.05). Inpatient mortality is lower in the early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) group (OR: 0.79 < 0.11), however, it is not statistically significant. Both early Impella (OR: 1.73 < 0.05) and early extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (OR: 3.10 <i>P</i> < 0.05) in the LC group were associated with increased mortality. Early PCI (-2.57 <i>P</i> < 0.05) and Impella (-3.25 <i>P</i> < 0.05) were also both associated with shorter LOS compared to those who did not. Early ECMO does not impact the LOS; however, it does increase total hospital charge (addition of $24717.85, <i>P</i> < 0.05). LC is associated with a significantly increased inpatient mortality, length of stay, and total hospital charges in patients who develop SRCS. Rural and Non-teaching hospitals have significantly increased odds of extended hospital stays and higher adjusted total hospital charges. The Association of LC with worse outcomes outlines the essential need to monitor these patients closely and treat them early on with higher acuity care. Patients with early PCI had both shorter LOS and reduced inpatient mortality, while early Impella was associated with increased mortality and shorter LOS. Early ECMO is associated with increased mortality and higher total hospital charges. This finding should affect the decision to follow through with interventional management in this cohort of patients as it is associated with poor outcomes and immense resource utilization.",

This review focusses on the use of artificial intelligence for small bowel pathology compared with human data and developments to date. The diagnosis and management of small bowel disease has been revolutionized with the advent of capsule endoscopy. Reading of capsule endoscopy videos however is time consuming with an average reading time of 40 min. Furthermore, the fatigued human eye may miss subtle lesions including indiscreet mucosal bulges. In recent years, artificial intelligence has made significant progress in the field of medicine including gastroenterology. Machine learning has enabled feature extraction and in combination with deep neural networks, image classification has now materialized for routine endoscopy for the clinician. Artificial intelligence is in built within the Navicam-Ankon capsule endoscopy reading system. This development will no doubt expand to other capsule endoscopy platforms and capsule endoscopies that are used to visualize other parts of the gastrointestinal tract as a standard. This wireless and patient friendly technique combined with rapid reading platforms with the help of artificial intelligence will become an attractive and viable choice to alter how patients are investigated in the future.",

        "Abstract": "To summarize the clinical characteristics and treatment experience of gastric primary lymphoma with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding as the primary manifestation, and to provide support for clinical treatment. Information on gastric primary lymphoma patients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University between January 2010 and March 2021 for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding was retrospectively collected. Data on endoscopic morphology, tumor staging, pathology typing, severity of bleeding, risks of rebleeding, treatment and inhospital prognosis were documented and analyzed. A total of 25 patients with a mean age of 57.2 years were included in the study, all of whom presented clinically with melena (100%), 9 (36%) had hematemesis, and 6 (24%) was accompanied with abdominal pain. Twenty, or 80%, of the gastric lymphoma patients with bleeding as the primary manifestation showed endoscopically a tumor-forming phenotype (Yao Classification), mostly involving the middle and lower parts of the gastric body (44% and 32%, respectively). After conservative treatment with medication, rebleeding occurred in 4 patients during hospitalization. One of them required endoscopic hemostasis, two required surgical resection to stop the bleeding, and one decided not to undergo any further treatment. Only one patient died from infection and no death resulted directly from severe bleeding. Gastric primary lymphoma presenting acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding as the sole clinical manifestation rarely occurs, but when the condition does occur, it shows a wide range of endoscopic involvement. It has a higher risk of rebleeding, and endoscopic or surgical treatment may be attempted when conservative medication treatment for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding fails.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the diagnostic performance of blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio in differentiating the site of gastrointestinal bleeding, and to assess the predictive value of early elevated BUN/Cr ratio for clinical outcomes in patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ANVUGIB). The adult patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding who were hospitalized in the Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University between May 2020 and May 2021 were retrospectively enrolled. According to the site of gastrointestinal bleeding, the patients were divided into the upper gastrointestinal tract group, the proximal small intestinal bleeding group, and the distal small intestinal and colonic bleeding group. According to the early dynamic changes of BUN/Cr ratio within 6-48 hours after admission, patients with ANVUGIB were divided into early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio group and non-early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the diagnostic performance of BUN/Cr ratio in differentiating the site of gastrointestinal bleeding and examine the predictive efficacy of early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio after admission, Rockall scoring system, and the combined indicator of the two for estimating the primary clinical outcomes in ANVUGIB patients. A total of 266 patients were enrolled. Among them, 204 cases were in the upper gastrointestinal bleeding group, 15 cases were in the proximal small intestinal bleeding group, and 47 cases were in the distal small intestinal and colonic bleeding group. In the ANVUGIB patients, 16 were in the group with early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio after admission, and 146 were in the group with non-early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio after admission. The area under the ROC curve of the BUN/Cr ratio was 0.831 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.780-0.874), the optimal cut-off value being 34.59 mg/g for differentiation between upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The area under the ROC curve of the BUN/Cr ratio was 0.901 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.798-0.963) and the optimal cut-off value was 19.27 mg/g for differentiation between proximal small intestinal bleeding and the distal small intestinal and colonic bleeding. The area under the ROC curve of the early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio after admission was 0.806 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.737-0.864) for predicting the primary clinical outcome in patients with ANVUGIB. The area under the ROC curve of the combined indicator included the early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio after admission and the Rockall scoring system was 0.909 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.854-0.949) for predicting the primary clinical outcome in patients with ANVUGIB. The BUN/Cr ratio shows rather reliable diagnostic performance for identifying the site of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the early dynamic elevated BUN/Cr ratio after admission is a reliable indicator for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with ANVUGIB.",

        "Title": "[Current Interventional Management of Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding].",
        "Abstract": "Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), a common medical emergency, causes significant morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic evaluation and treatment remain the standard care in patients who can be hemodynamically stabilized. However, severe bleeding despite conservative medication treatment or medication combined with endoscopic intervention occurs in 5%-10% of patients, requiring interventional or surgical treatment. Endovascular embolization has emerged as an alternative to emergency operative intervention for high-risk patients with non-variceal UGIB and is now commonly considered the first-line therapy for refractory bleeding after endoscopic treatment. Child-Pugh class C or class B cirrhosis patients who have varicosity or active bleeding detected in endoscopy are at high risks for treatment failure, rebleeding, and death. A preemptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been shown to reduce treatment failure and mortality significantly. Herein, we reviewed the current role of interventional treatment in the management of massive UGIB on the basis of years of clinical experience of the Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University.",

        "Title": "Differences in medication reconciliation interventions between six hospitals: a mixed method study.",
        "Abstract": "Although medication reconciliation (MedRec) is mandated and effective in decreasing preventable medication errors during transition of care, hospitals implement MedRec differently. Quantitatively compare the number and type of MedRec interventions between hospitals upon admission and discharge, followed by a qualitative analysis on potential reasons for differences. This explanatory retrospective mixed-method study consisted of a quantitative and a qualitative part. Patients from six hospitals and six different wards i.e. orthopaedics, surgery, pulmonary diseases, internal medicine, cardiology and gastroenterology were included. At these wards, MedRec was implemented both on hospital admission and discharge. The number of pharmacy interventions was collected and classified in two subcategories. First, the number of interventions to resolve unintended discrepancies (elimination of differences between listed medication and the patient's actual medication use). And second, the number of medication optimizations (optimization of pharmacotherapy e.g. eliminating double medication). Based on these quantitative results and interviews, a focus group was performed to give insight in local MedRec processes to address differences in context between hospitals. Descriptive analysis (quantitative) and content analysis (qualitative) was used. On admission 765 (85%) patients from six hospitals, received MedRec by trained nurses, pharmacy technicians, pharmaceutical consultants or pharmacists. Of those, 36-95% (mean per patient 2.2 (SD ± 2.4)) had at least one discrepancy. Upon discharge, these numbers were among 632 (70%) of patients, 5-28% (mean per patient 0.7 (SD 1.2)). Optimizations in pharmacotherapy were implemented for 2% (0.4-3.7 interventions per patient upon admission) to 95% (0.1-1.7 interventions per patient upon discharge) of patients. The main themes explaining differences in numbers of interventions were patient-mix, the type of healthcare professionals involved, where and when patient interviews for MedRec were performed and finally, embedding and extent of medication optimization. Hospitals differed greatly in the number of interventions performed during MedRec. Differences in execution of MedRec and local context determines the number of interventions. This study can support hospitals who want to optimize MedRec processes.",

        "Abstract": "Biosimilars represent a novel category in the world of follow-up medicinal products with the requirement that they are highly similar but not identical to an approved originator biologic medicine, with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. In this review, we discuss recent pivotal biosimilar developments for anti-inflammatory therapy in rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, and the influence of biosimilar availability on patients and payers. Finally, we provide our perspective on the evolution of biosimilar use in these indications in the United States (US) and in Europe and on where this evolution in biopharmaceuticals may lead in the future. Although biosimilars are commonly used in the European Union (EU), there will be an inevitable sea change of acceptance by clinicians, patients, payers, and regulators in the US. It is paramount to educate about biosimilarity, highlighting currently available data gathered from other geographies, in addition to gradually providing clinicians and patients with the necessary experience with these agents ultimately restoring competition in the biologics landscape.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence has been rapidly deployed in gastroenterology and endoscopy. The acceleration of deep convolutional neural networks along with hardware development has allowed implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms into real-time endoscopy, particularly colonoscopy. However, artificial intelligence implementation in pancreaticobiliary endoscopy is nascent. Initial studies have been conducted in endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and digital single operator cholangioscopy (DSOC). Machine learning has been implemented in identifying significant landmarks, including the ampulla on ERCP, and the bile duct, pancreas, and portal confluence on EUS. Moreover, artificial intelligence algorithms have been deployed in differentiating pathology including pancreas cancer, autoimmune pancreatitis, pancreatic cystic lesions, and biliary strictures. There have been relatively few studies with limited sample sizes in developing these machine learning algorithms. Despite the early successful demonstration of artificial intelligence in pancreaticobiliary endoscopy, additional research needs to be conducted with larger data sets to improve generalizability and assessed in real-time endoscopy before clinical implementation. However, pancreaticobiliary endoscopy remains a promising avenue of artificial intelligence application with the potential to improve clinical practice and outcomes.",

        "Title": "Organoids in gastrointestinal diseases: from experimental models to clinical translation.",
        "Abstract": "We are entering an era of medicine where increasingly sophisticated data will be obtained from patients to determine proper diagnosis, predict outcomes and direct therapies. We predict that the most valuable data will be produced by systems that are highly dynamic in both time and space. Three-dimensional (3D) organoids are poised to be such a highly valuable system for a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. In the lab, organoids have emerged as powerful systems to model molecular and cellular processes orchestrating natural and pathophysiological human tissue formation in remarkable detail. Preclinical studies have impressively demonstrated that these organs-in-a-dish can be used to model immunological, neoplastic, metabolic or infectious GI disorders by taking advantage of patient-derived material. Technological breakthroughs now allow to study cellular communication and molecular mechanisms of interorgan cross-talk in health and disease including communication along for example, the gut-brain axis or gut-liver axis. Despite considerable success in culturing classical 3D organoids from various parts of the GI tract, some challenges remain to develop these systems to best help patients. Novel platforms such as organ-on-a-chip, engineered biomimetic systems including engineered organoids, micromanufacturing, bioprinting and enhanced rigour and reproducibility will open improved avenues for tissue engineering, as well as regenerative and personalised medicine. This review will highlight some of the established methods and also some exciting novel perspectives on organoids in the fields of gastroenterology. At present, this field is poised to move forward and impact many currently intractable GI diseases in the form of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Most CRCs develop through either the adenoma-to-carcinoma or the serrated pathways, and, therefore, detection and removal of these precursor lesions can prevent the development of cancer. Current screening programmes can aid in the detection of CRC and adenomas; however, participation rates are suboptimal. Blood-based biomarkers may help to address these low participation rates in screening programmes. Although blood-based biomarker tests show promise for cancer detection, limited attention has been placed on the sensitivity and specificity for detection of the precursor lesions. The aim of this research is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of blood-based biomarker tests in detecting advanced precancerous lesions. This protocol was informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols (PRISMA-P) and results will be reported in line with the PRISMA guidelines. Literature searches will be conducted on PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Two reviewers will conduct the searches, and independently screen them, according to title and abstract and then the full-text versions of those selected articles as well as the risk of bias via the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines will be used to validate the certainty of evidence for recommendations based on the risk of bias findings. Meta-analysis will be conducted where appropriate on groups of studies with low heterogeneity. No patient data will be included in our review and, therefore, ethics approval is not required. It is anticipated that the review will identify the most promising candidate biomarkers for clinical translation in the screening of advanced precancerous lesions. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CRD42021285173.",

        "Title": "Role of silymarin as antioxidant in clinical management of chronic liver diseases: a narrative review.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic liver disease (CLD), manifested as hepatic injury, is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. CLD progresses to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and-ultimately-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) if left untreated. The different phenotypes of CLD based on their respective clinical features and causative agents include alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The preferred treatment modality for CLD includes lifestyle modification and diet, along with limited pharmacological agents for symptomatic treatment. Moreover, oxidative stress (OS) is an important pathological mechanism underlying all CLD phenotypes; hence, the use of antioxidants to manage the disease is justified. Based on available clinical evidence, silymarin can be utilized as a hepatoprotective agent, given its potent antioxidant, antifibrotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The role of silymarin in suppressing OS has been well established, and therefore silymarin is recommended for use in ALD and NAFLD in the guidelines approved by the Russian Medical Scientific Society of Therapists and the Gastroenterology Scientific Society of Russia. However, to discuss the positioning of the original silymarin in clinical guidelines and treatment protocols as a hepatoprotective agent for managing CLD concomitantly with other therapies, an expert panel of international and Russian medical professionals was convened on 11 November 2020. The panel reviewed approaches for the prevention and treatment of OS, existing guidelines for patient management for CLD, and available evidence on the effectiveness of silymarin in reducing OS, fibrosis, and hepatic inflammation and presented in the form of a narrative review. Key messagesAn expert panel of international and Russian medical professionals reviewed existing guidelines for ALD, NAFLD, MAFLD, and DILI to establish consensus recommendations that oxidative stress is the common pathophysiological mechanism underlying these conditions.The panel also discussed the positioning of original silymarin in clinical guidelines and treatment protocols as a hepatoprotective agent for managing CLD concomitantly with other therapies.The panel reviewed the effectiveness of 140 mg original silymarin three times a day in reducing oxidative stress in chronic liver diseases such as ALD, NAFLD, MAFLD, and DILI.",

        "Title": "Endoscopic resection of superficial bowel neoplasia: The unmet needs in the Egyptian practice.",
        "Abstract": "Management of superficial bowel neoplasia (SBN) in early stages is associated with better outcomes. The last few decades experienced a paradigm shift in the management of SBN with the introduction of advanced endoscopic resection techniques (ERTs). However, there are no clear data about the aspects of ERTs in Egypt despite the growing gastroenterology practice. To investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of ERTs toward management of SBN among Egyptian practitioners and the suitability of the endoscopy units' infrastructures toward these techniques. An online 2-pages questionnaire was used. The first page comprised demographic data, and questions for all physicians, about the knowledge (11 questions) of and attitude (5 questions) toward ERTs as a therapeutic option for SBN. The second page investigated the practice of ERTs by endoscopists (6 questions) and the infrastructures of their endoscopy units (14 questions). The survey was disseminated through July 2021 and the data were collected in an excel sheet and later analyzed anonymously. The complete responses were 833/2300 (36.2%). The majority of the participants were males (<i>n</i> = 560, 67.2%), middle-aged (<i>n</i> = 366, 43.9%), consultants (<i>n</i> = 464, 55.7%), gastroenterologists (<i>n</i> = 678, 81.4%), spending ≥ 15 years in practice (<i>n</i> = 368, 44.2%), and were working in university hospitals (<i>n</i> = 569, 68.3%). The majority correctly identified the definition of SBN (88.4%) and the terms polypectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) (92.1%, 90.2%, and 89.1% respectively). However, 26.9%, 43.2% and 49.5% did not recognize the clear indication of polypectomy, EMR, and ESD respectively. Although 68.1% of physicians are convinced about the ERTs for management of SBN; only 8.9% referred all candidate cases for ERTs. About 76.5% of endoscopists had formal training in the basic polypectomy techniques while formal training for EMR and ESD was encountered only in 31.9% and 7.2% respectively. About 71.6% and 88.4% of endoscopists did not perform EMR or ESD in the last one year. Consequently, the complication rate reported by endoscopists was limited to 18.1% (<i>n</i> = 103) of endoscopists. Only 25.8% of endoscopists feel confident in the management of ERTs-related complications and a half (49.9%) were not sure about their competency. Regarding the endoscopy units' infrastructures, only 4.2% of the centers had their endoscopes 100% armed with optical enhancements and 54.4% considered their institutions ready for managing ERTs-related complications. Only 18.3% (<i>n</i> = 104) of endoscopists treated their complicated cases surgically because the most frequent ERTs-related complications were procedural bleeding (26.7%), and perforations (17%). A significant deficiency was reported in the knowledge and attitude of Egyptian practitioners caring for patients with SBN toward ERTs. The lack of trained endoscopists in both EMR and ESD in part is due to unsuitable infrastructures of many endoscopy units.",

        "Abstract": "There remains a dearth of Asian epidemiological literature for paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD). To describe the presenting features of PIBD from 7 Asia-Pacific pediatric gastroenterology centers <i>via</i> a central standardised electronic data platform. Clinical, endoscopic and radiologic data at diagnosis from the registry were extracted between 1<sup>st</sup> January 1995 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019. Disease phenotypic characteristics were classified as per the Paris classification system. There was a distinct rise in new PIBD cases: Nearly half (48.6%) of the cohort was diagnosed in the most recent 5 years (2015-2019). The ratio of Crohn's disease (CD):Ulcerative colitis (UC):IBD-Unclassified was 55.9%:38.3%:5.8%. The mean age was 9.07 years with a high proportion of very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) (29.3%) and EO-IBD (52.7%). An over-representation of the Indian/South Asian ethnic group was observed which accounted for 37.0% of the overall Singapore/Malaysia subcohort (6.8%-9.0% Indians in census). Indian/South Asian CD patients were also most likely to present with symptomatic perianal disease (<i>P</i> = 0.003). CD patients presented with significantly more constitutional symptoms (fever, anorexia, malaise/fatigue and muscle-wasting) than UC and higher inflammatory indices (higher C-reactive protein and lower albumin levels). We observed a high incidence of VEO-IBD and an over-representation of the Indian ethnicity. South Asian CD patients were more likely to have symptomatic perianal disease.",

        "Title": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment-Overview.",
        "Abstract": "This article is an overview of guidelines for the clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment of predominantly colonic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This overview describes the systematically and comprehensively multidisciplinary recommendations based on the updated principles of evidence-based literature to promote the adoption of best surgical practices and research as well as patient and specialized healthcare provider education. Colonic IBD represents idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory disorders encompassing Crohn's colitis (CC) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two unsolved medical subtypes of this condition, which present similarity in their clinical and histopathological characteristics. The standard state-of-the-art classification diagnostic steps are disease evaluation and assessment according to the Montreal classification to enable explicit communication with professionals. The signs and symptoms on first presentation are mainly connected with the anatomical localization and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis \"CC\" or \"UC\". This can clinically and histologically be non-definitive to interpret to establish criteria and is classified as indeterminate colitis (IC). Conservative surgical intervention varies depending on the disease phenotype and accessible avenues. The World Gastroenterology Organizations has, for this reason, recommended guidelines for clinical diagnosis and management. Surgical intervention is indicated when conservative treatment is ineffective (refractory), during intractable gastrointestinal hemorrhage, in obstructive gastrointestinal luminal stenosis (due to fibrotic scar tissue), or in the case of abscesses, peritonitis, or complicated fistula formation. The risk of colitis-associated colorectal cancer is realizable in IBD patients before and after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance strategies, aimed at the early detection of dysplasia, are recommended. During the COVID-19 pandemic, IBD patients continued to be admitted for IBD-related surgical interventions. Virtual and phone call follow-ups reinforcing the continuity of care are recommended. There is a need for special guidelines that explore solutions to the groundwork gap in terms of access limitations to IBD care in developing countries, and the irregular representation of socioeconomic stratification needs a strategic plan for how to address this serious emerging challenge in the global pandemic.",

        "Title": "The Need for Oral Hygiene Care and Periodontal Status among Hospitalized Gastric Cancer Patients.",
        "Abstract": "Poor oral hygiene leads to the accumulation of dental plaque, thus contributing to the initiation of periodontal disease (PD). Local infections can lead to systemic inflammatory responses, which are essential mediators for the evolution of systemic conditions or cancer tumorigenesis. Often, patients hospitalized with life-threatening and incapacitating disorders such as gastric cancer (GC) might lose interest in keeping their mouth healthy. This study evaluates oral hygiene, periodontal status, and the need for oral care and medical personnel to assist in achieving it in patients hospitalized with GC. This study was carried out on 25 patients with a diagnosis of GC, divided into two groups (GP-14 patients from the Gastroenterology Department, and SP-11 patients from the 1st Department of Surgery). Patients were examined on the day of admission (T0), the day of the medical procedure of endoscopy or surgery (T1), and the day of discharge (T2), recording the number of absent teeth, dental plaque (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depths (PPD), frequency of toothbrushing, and if the oral hygiene had been self-performed or assisted. Data were subjected to statistical analysis. Our results showed that, in both the GP and the SP group, there were strong and statistically significant correlations between PI and BOP measured on the last day of hospitalization and the period of hospitalization after the medical procedure. Longer hospital stays and the presence of surgery were risk factors for changing toothbrushing frequency. Results also highlight the need for a dentist to diagnose and eventually treat periodontal disease before and after hospitalization, and for a trained nurse who should help take care of the patient's oral hygiene during hospitalization.",

        "Abstract": "Given the cost and complexity of home subcutaneous biologic use, a centralized specialty medication management (CSMM) service was developed utilizing clinical pharmacist practitioners (CPPs). To determine the implementation feasibility of the CSMM service. The CSMM service was implemented in a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospital. The VHA does not use dedicated specialty pharmacies. The CSMM service was developed utilizing CPPs who operated as an advance practice provider under a national VHA scope of practice. The CPP staffing the CSMM service performed patient education, screened for medication appropriateness, and monitored for safety and efficacy via videoconference or telephone. All patients newly starting a home subcutaneous biologic were offered the service from allergy, cardiology, dermatology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology clinics, as appropriate. A retrospective chart review was completed through the first year the service was offered, which included the recruitment and retention of patients, number of follow-up appointments, and interventions made. Of the 68 patients offered clinic enrollment, 54 were enrolled in the service (79.4%). Of the 44 who had completed an initial appointment with the CPP, 42 had either received an initial follow-up or were scheduled for a follow-up (95.5%). A total of 161 clinical outcomes have been performed by the CSMM CPP including administrative assistance (33.5%), initial patient education (17.4%), technique correction (7.5%), and medication changes or discontinuations (6.8%). Given the high rate of enrollment and retention, the implementation of the CSMM service at a VA hospital was feasible. The service contributed to safe and effective medication use for enrolled patients and continues to grow in both patient enrollment and services offered.",

Despite the fact that there are different guidelines and recommendations on the management of children with CMPA, there continues to be great variability in diagnostic and therapeutic criteria in Latin America. The Food Allergy Working Group of the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition summoned a group of Latin American experts to reach a consensus and formulate a document to unify diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for CMPA. Three teams were formed, each with a coordinator, and the members of each team developed a series of statements for their corresponding module: a) clinical manifestations and diagnosis; b) diagnostic tools, and c) treatment. A search of the medical literature was carried out to support the information presented in each module and 28 statements were then selected. The statements were discussed, after which they were evaluated by all the experts, utilizing the Delphi method. Their opinions on statement agreement or disagreement were anonymously issued. The final statements selected were those with above 75% agreement and their corresponding recommendations were formulated, resulting in the document presented herein.",

        "Abstract": "Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the first line management to induce remission of active Crohn's disease (CD). EEN is well established but there continues to be significant variation in practice especially in relation to what first line formula is used, length of time on EEN, and food reintroduction. The survey aimed to establish dietetic practices in implementing EEN in the management of active CD across specialist paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) centres. An online, cross-sectional survey was developed, piloted, and distributed to dietitians working at tertiary paediatric IBD centres. Centres were identified through a member of the British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (BSPGHAN) working group. All 20 specialist IBD centres within the United Kingdom were approached and invited to complete the survey. Eighty-five percent (17/20) of the specialist IBD centres in the UK responded. 100% of centres used polymeric feeds as their first line and 70% (12/17) of centres recommended EEN for 6 weeks. Dietetic monitoring whilst on EEN over the 6-8 weeks varied significantly, ranging from 30% (5/17) of centres monitored weekly compared with 30% of centres (5/17) only if clinical need indicated. There was a wide range in practices regarding which foods and drinks were permitted whilst on EEN. Forty three percent (7/17) introduced solid foods over five to seven days, 19% (3/17) introduced food over seven to 14 days and 38% (6/17) introduced food over a minimum of 14 days. Eighteen percent (3/17) of centres were offering the Crohn's disease exclusion diet as a treatment for IBD. Despite available evidenced based guidelines there is still considerable variation in the management of EEN to induce remission in active CD especially in relation to frequency of dietetic review and foods permitted during and after EEN. Further research is required to understand the impact this may have on achieving and maintaining remission in CD.",

        "Abstract": "The Swedish Pancreatitis Cohort (SwePan) was designed to study long-term outcomes following an episode of acute pancreatitis. It can also be used to study various risk factors for developing acute pancreatitis. The SwePan is a register-based nationwide matched cohort. It includes all Swedish cases of acute pancreatitis during 1990-2019. It contains 95 632 individuals with acute pancreatitis and 952 783 pancreatitis-free individuals matched on sex, age and municipality of residence. Follow-up was censored at death, emigration or end of study (31 December 2019). The dataset includes comprehensive information based on several registries, and includes diagnoses, prescribed medications and socioeconomic factors both prior to inclusion and during follow-up. During the study period, the number of cases of acute pancreatitis in Sweden has more than doubled from 1977 cases in 1990 to 4264 cases in 2019. The median age of first episode of acute pancreatitis has increased from 58 years (IQR 44-73 years) in 1990 to 64 years (IQR 49-76 years) in 2019. Cases with acute pancreatitis were generally less healthy compared with the pancreatitis-free individuals (Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0 in 59.2% and 71.4%, respectively). SwePan will be used to determine the incidence of acute pancreatitis in Sweden over time and assess long-term all-cause and cause-specific mortality after an episode of acute pancreatitis. Some examples of additional planned studies are (1) assessment of long-term risk of diabetes and (2) risk of malignancy in adjacent organs following acute pancreatitis and (3) assessment of risk factors for development of acute pancreatitis including various drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Increased utilization of pediatric psychology services has been demonstrated following integration into urban pediatric gastroenterology clinics; however, examination within rural health systems is lacking. Utilization of pediatric psychology services was assessed through a retrospective analysis of Electronic Health Record data contrasting referrals occurring six months pre- and post-integration of pediatric psychology in an outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic within a rural setting. Significant increases in the number of referrals to pediatric psychology and number of billed initial visits were observed after integration, as was a significant decrease in time to be seen. Patients with public insurance were 3.1 times more likely to complete a billed initial visit compared with patients with nonpublic insurance. The current findings support the integration of pediatric psychology within rural outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinics to increase utilization and allow more traditionally underserved families to benefit from these services.",

        "Abstract": "TMEM67 (mecklin or MKS3) locates in the transition zone of cilia. Dysfunction of TMEM67 disrupts cilia-related signaling and leads to developmental defects of multiple organs in humans. Typical autosomal recessive TMEM67 defects cause partial overlapping phenotypes, including abnormalities in the brain, eyes, liver, kidneys, bones, and so forth. However, emerging reports of isolated nephronophthisis suggest the possibility of a broader phenotype spectrum. In this study, we analyzed the genetic data of cholestasis patients with no obvious extrahepatic involvement but with an unexplained high level of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). We identified five Han Chinese patients from three unrelated families with biallelic nonnull low-frequency TMEM67 variants. All variants were predicted pathogenic in silico, of which p. Arg820Ile and p. Leu144del were previously unreported. In vitro studies revealed that the protein levels of the TMEM67 variants were significantly decreased; however, their interaction with MKS1 remained unaffected. All the patients, aged 7-39 years old, had silently progressive cholestasis with elevated GGT but had normal bilirubin levels. Histological studies of liver biopsy of patients 1, 3, and 5 showed the presence of congenital hepatic fibrosis. We conclude that variants in TMEM67 are associated with a mild phenotype of unexplained, persistent, anicteric, and high GGT cholestasis without typical symptoms of TMEM67 defects; this possibility should be considered by physicians in gastroenterology and hepatology.",

The guidelines also recommend routine screening for the presence of symptoms in patients with PBC, although none suggest how such screening should be achieved in clinical practice. We aim to develop a sustainable and comprehensive local registry for patients with PBC to examine current practice and help define long-term complications and survival. Setting up the registry involves working with several workstreams to identify the data required for the registry, technical IT infrastructure to support the data collection, and a steering committee to oversee the work of the PBC registry. This registry will involve patients aged ≥18 years from the London North West University Health Trust hospitals with a diagnosis of PBC as defined by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria. Patients will not be subjected to any additional treatments or investigations as the registry will be part of routine clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The gene mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) were found in most patients with CRC. They function as important inducers of tumorigenesis. Based on our microarray results, we identified a specific upregulated lncRNA in CRC (SURC). Further analysis showed that high SURC expression correlated with poorer disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with CRC. Furthermore, we found that mutated APC genes can promote the transcription of SURC by reducing the degradation of β-catenin protein in CRC. Functional assays revealed that knockdown of SURC impaired CRC cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, and tumor growth. Additionally, SURC promotes CCND2 expression by inhibiting the expression of miR-185-5p in CRC cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SURC is a specific upregulated lncRNA in CRC and the SURC/miR-185-5p/CCND2 axis may be targetable for CRC diagnosis and therapy.",

        "Title": "A Shigella species variant is causally linked to intractable functional constipation.",
        "Abstract": "Intractable functional constipation (IFC) is the most severe form of constipation, but its etiology has long been unknown. We hypothesized that IFC is caused by refractory infection by a pathogenic bacterium. Here, we isolated from patients with IFC a Shigella species - peristaltic contraction-inhibiting bacterium (PIB) - that significantly inhibited peristaltic contraction of the colon by production of docosapentenoic acid (DPA). PIB colonized mice for at least 6 months. Oral administration of PIB was sufficient to induce constipation, which was reversed by PIB-specific phages. A mutated PIB with reduced DPA was incapable of inhibiting colonic function and inducing constipation, suggesting that DPA produced by PIB was the key mediator of the genesis of constipation. PIBs were detected in stools of 56% (38 of 68) of the IFC patients, but not in those of non-IFC or healthy individuals (0 of 180). DPA levels in stools were elevated in 44.12% (30 of 68) of the IFC patients but none of the healthy volunteers (0 of 97). Our results suggest that Shigella sp. PIB may be the critical causative pathogen for IFC, and detection of fecal PIB plus DPA may be a reliable method for IFC diagnosis and classification.",

        "Abstract": "Newer intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs), such as fish oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions (FO-ILEs) and soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions (SMOF-ILEs), provide alternatives to soybean oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions (SO-ILEs). We explored current ILE practice patterns among intestinal rehabilitation and transplant centers. A survey was developed addressing ILE availability, ILE preference in clinical scenarios, and factors influencing ILE choice. This survey was reviewed locally and by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Intestinal Rehabilitation Special Interest Group, the Intestinal Rehabilitation and Transplant Association scientific committee, and the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition pediatric intestinal failure section research committee. We recruited providers nationally and internationally from centers with and without intestinal transplant programs. We included 34 complete responses, 29 from the United States. Sixteen centers performed intestinal transplants. All centers had access to SMOF-ILEs, 85% had access to FO-ILEs, and 91% had access to SO-ILEs. In new patients, 85% use SMOF-ILEs as the first choice ILE. In those with new intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), FO-ILE was preferred to SMOF-ILE (56% vs 38%). In those developing IFALD on SMOF-ILE, 65% switched to FO-ILE, whereas 24% remained on SMOF-ILE. Centers have routine access to alternative ILEs, and these are quickly replacing SO-ILEs in all circumstances. Future work should focus on how this shift in practice affects outcomes to provide decision support in specific clinical scenarios.",

        "Title": "Fast machine learning annotation in the medical domain: a semi-automated video annotation tool for gastroenterologists.",
        "Abstract": "Machine learning, especially deep learning, is becoming more and more relevant in research and development in the medical domain. For all the supervised deep learning applications, data is the most critical factor in securing successful implementation and sustaining the progress of the machine learning model. Especially gastroenterological data, which often involves endoscopic videos, are cumbersome to annotate. Domain experts are needed to interpret and annotate the videos. To support those domain experts, we generated a framework. With this framework, instead of annotating every frame in the video sequence, experts are just performing key annotations at the beginning and the end of sequences with pathologies, e.g., visible polyps. Subsequently, non-expert annotators supported by machine learning add the missing annotations for the frames in-between. In our framework, an expert reviews the video and annotates a few video frames to verify the object's annotations for the non-expert. In a second step, a non-expert has visual confirmation of the given object and can annotate all following and preceding frames with AI assistance. After the expert has finished, relevant frames will be selected and passed on to an AI model. This information allows the AI model to detect and mark the desired object on all following and preceding frames with an annotation. Therefore, the non-expert can adjust and modify the AI predictions and export the results, which can then be used to train the AI model. Using this framework, we were able to reduce workload of domain experts on average by a factor of 20 on our data. This is primarily due to the structure of the framework, which is designed to minimize the workload of the domain expert. Pairing this framework with a state-of-the-art semi-automated AI model enhances the annotation speed further. Through a prospective study with 10 participants, we show that semi-automated annotation using our tool doubles the annotation speed of non-expert annotators compared to a well-known state-of-the-art annotation tool. In summary, we introduce a framework for fast expert annotation for gastroenterologists, which reduces the workload of the domain expert considerably while maintaining a very high annotation quality. The framework incorporates a semi-automated annotation system utilizing trained object detection models. The software and framework are open-source.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status and body composition in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), in accordance with the new nutritional targets defined by European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) 2016. In this cross-sectional study, data were collected prospectively in a single centre. A record was made for a total of 95 patients with CF of clinical data. Anthropometric data were evaluated using the World Health Organization growth standards. The bone mineral density (BMD) z-score was adjusted for height by measuring dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The speed of sound z-score values were measured with quantitative ultrasound (QUS). The nutritional status was normal in 37.9% of patients aged < 2 years and 33.3% of patients aged 2-18 years. When the DXA BMD z-score values were corrected for height, it was determined that the BMD deficit was less. The calcaneus QUS SOS z-score mean value was lower than the mean height for age z-score adjusted BMD (BMDHAZ). The malnutrition rates of CF patients were higher than the rates previously reported in literature. As there are insufficient nutritional data in Turkey, there is a need for multi-centre studies to determine the frequency of malnutrition according to the new classifications. It is clear that QUS measurements cannot replace DXA in the diagnosis of osteopenic bone disease. However, when low values are determined with QUS as the first recommended measurement in the screening of bone status, it can be considered appropriate to confirm the status with DXA.",

        "Abstract": "Compared to the prevalence and complications, there is still limited evidence in this regard. With an incidence rate of 200,000 cases annually and the induction of numerous complications, caustic ingestion imposes a significant burden on the healthcare system. Apart from being fatal in some cases, this injury affects its victims' quality of life as it is followed by many gastrointestinal problems. This injury mainly occurs accidentally among children, whereas in adults, it often occurs with suicidal intentions. Despite recent advances in internal medicine, gastroenterology, and toxicology, this type of injury remains a debilitating and, in some cases, fatal disorder for its victims. This study retrospectively evaluated the clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic findings of 150 patients admitted to a referral center of toxicology and forensic medicine and assessed factors associated with each type of injury. The findings indicated a mortality rate as high as 7.3% in this population. Age, pH, and previous medical conditions were associated with more complications. Higher degrees of injury were also significantly associated with higher mortality. No significant difference was observed between types of corrosive substances. It seems that the most effective intervention for controlling caustic ingestion injuries would be psychiatric support, primary healthcare, and household education.",

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> testing are routine parts of preoperative assessment of bariatric surgery at many centers. This was a crosssectional study of all patients underwent EGD and histopathological examination before laparoscopic RYGB in three gastroenterology centers in Iran between January 2018 and December 2020. In total, 637 patients (52.4% female) were enrolled, of which 46.8% had no abnormal mucosal appearance. In 1.7%, surgery was canceled (gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric intestinal metaplasia, GIST, and esophageal varices). The prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> was 61.5%, and there was no statistical difference between groups of normal and abnormal EGD; however, surgery was postponed after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication in both groups. Overall, 44.4% of patients with esophagitis (any grade), peptic ulcer disease, erosive and non-erosive gastritis/duodenitis, and short segment Barret's esophagus needed medical management. Small- or medium-sized sliding hiatal hernias were seen in 18.7% of patients with no effect on surgery. Moreover, 88.8% of patients with normal mucosal appearance were asymptomatic, but 92.6% in the group with abnormal EGD were symptomatic (<i>p</i>=0.01). Changes in surgical plan and time occurred in 63.6%, but after eliminating <i>H. pylori</i> eradication, it was 15.4%. Considering gastric cancer and the high prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> in Iran, using EGD and histopathological examination as an investigation in the preoperative assessment would have a significant impact on patients undergoing RYGB surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Chinese clinical pharmacists consider improving the quantity and quality of consultations to be an important task in providing better pharmaceutical care. To achieve this goal, we developed a clinical pharmacist consultation method using multidisciplinary individualized medication recommendations (MIMRs) and studied the effects of its implementation. A retrospective study of 812 clinical pharmacist-led consultations was conducted. In the pre-intervention group, medication advice was given based on the purpose of the consultation. In the post-intervention group, a consultation method using MIMRs was implemented, in which clinical pharmacists with specialties in anticoagulation, gastroenterology, and nutrition were asked to give individualized medication recommendations. Outcomes, including the effectiveness rate of consultations (ERC) and acceptance rate of consultations (ARC), were compared between the two groups using propensity score matching method. Patterns and numbers of consultations and individualized medication recommendations were also compared. The results showed that the ERC in the post-intervention group compared with the ERC in the pre-intervention group was 83.3% vs 74.0%, respectively (P < .05). Significant difference was also shown between the two groups in ARC (98.4% vs 92.2%, P < .05). The total number of consultations increased, as did the number of general consultations, multidisciplinary/difficult consultations, anti-infection consultations, and non-anti-infection consultations specifically. As a result, we proposed that the implementation of MIMRs can improve the effects of treatment and increase the number of consultations by pharmacists, which is worthy of further promotion to better serve physicians and patients.",

        "Abstract": "The exposure risks to front-line health care workers caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing surgery or obstetric delivery are unclear, and an understanding of sample types that may harbour virus is important for evaluating risk. We sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing surgery or obstetric delivery was present in the peritoneal cavity of male and female patients, in the female reproductive tract, in the environment of the surgery or delivery suite (surgical instruments or equipment used, air or floors), and inside the masks of the attending health care workers. We conducted a cross-sectional study from November 2020 to May 2021 at 2 tertiary academic Toronto hospitals, during urgent surgeries or obstetric deliveries for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in patient, environmental and air samples was identified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Air samples were collected using both active and passive sampling techniques. The primary outcome was the proportion of health care workers' masks positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We included adult patients with positive RT-PCR nasal swab undergoing obstetric delivery or urgent surgery (from across all surgical specialties). A total of 32 patients (age 20-88 yr) were included. Nine patients had obstetric deliveries (6 cesarean deliveries), and 23 patients (14 male) required urgent surgery from the orthopedic or trauma, general surgery, burn, plastic surgery, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, vascular surgery, gastroenterology and gynecologic oncology divisions. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20 of 332 (6%) patient and environmental samples collected: 4 of 24 (17%) patient samples, 5 of 60 (8%) floor samples, 1 of 54 (2%) air samples, 10 of 23 (43%) surgical instrument or equipment samples, 0 of 24 cautery filter samples and 0 of 143 (95% confidence interval 0-0.026) inner surface of mask samples. During the study period of November 2020 to May 2021, we found evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a small but important number of samples obtained in the surgical and obstetric operative environment. The finding of no detectable virus inside the masks worn by the health care teams would suggest a low risk of infection for health care workers using appropriate personal protective equipment.",

We've used a public application programming interface (API) U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to access the PubMed database. Data lock was performed on April 19, 2022. The API was used to retrieve all available IBD AND Covid-19 -related entries. For each retrieved entry, we've also obtained its citation count. The top 25 manuscripts were published between 2020 and 2021. The total citation count is 2051. The citation count of articles ranged from 41 to 313. The top 25 manuscripts were published in eight journals, while 16 were published in Gastroenterology and Gut. 36% of the most cited manuscripts reported clinical characteristics and patient outcomes, and 32% dealt with patient management. The most impactful manuscripts provided evidence that IBD patients are not at increased risk for severe morbidity or mortality from Covid-19 and that it is not advisable to discontinue the anti-inflammatory treatment for IBD during the pandemic. Two basic science studies demonstrated mechanistic insights for these observations. Studies that examined the immunogenic response of IBD patients treated with biologics were also part of the top-cited list. Impactful scientific publications on Covid-19 in IBD patients provided reassurance and directed treatment at the time of this newly recognized severe disease.",

        "Abstract": "Thromboprophylaxis use in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is inconsistent. Current guidelines only support treating children with acute severe colitis with risk factors. We convened an international RAND panel to explore thromboprophylaxis in paediatric IBD inpatients in the context of new evidence. We convened a geographically diverse 14-person panel of paediatric gastroenterologists alongside supporting experts. An online survey was sent before an online meeting. Panellists were asked to rate the appropriateness of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised paediatric IBD patients via 27 scenarios of varying ages, gender, and phenotype, with and without thrombotic risk factors. Anonymised results were presented at the meeting. A second modified survey was distributed to all panellists present at the meeting. Results from the second survey constitute the RAND panel results. The validated RAND disagreement index defined disagreement when ≥ 1. The combined outcome of thromboprophylaxis being considered appropriate until discharge and inappropriate to withhold was seen in 20 of 27 scenarios, including: all patients with new-onset acute severe colitis; all flares of known ulcerative colitis, irrespective of risk factors except in pre-pubescent patients with limited disease and no risk factors; and all Crohn's patients with risk factors. Disagreement was seen in five scenarios regarding Crohn's without risk factors, where outcomes were already uncertain. RAND panels are an established method to assess expert opinion in areas of limited evidence. This work therefore constitutes neither a guideline nor a consensus; however, the findings suggest a need to re-evaluate the role of thromboprophylaxis in future guidelines.",

        "Abstract": "Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are highly prevalent, estimated to affect about 40% of the global population. Patients with DGBI are still inadequately treated and face stigma which adversely impacts their disease course. A 12-question multiple-choice anonymous survey was distributed electronically to all adult gastroenterology fellowship program directors across the United States. Data were collected on demographics, training, attitudes, and knowledge in managing patients with DGBI. 9.8% and 15.9% of all trainees reported that their attendings and peers often demonstrated a dismissive attitude towards patients with DGBI, respectively. 21.4% of all trainees often felt frustrated or burned out when seeing patients with DGBI with increasing odds of burnout by years of training (OR 4.4 for F3 trainees, trainees in their third year of training). Significantly, more female trainees reported frustration and burnout when seeing patients with DGBI (p = 0.005). 28.6% of all trainees report they often do not want to see patients with DGBI in their outpatient GI practice, including 39.6% of F3 trainees. 27.1% of F3 trainees reported that they were uncomfortable with titrating neuromodulators and only 31.6% of all trainees were comfortable knowing when to refer to a gastropsychologist. Many trainees expressed some unwillingness and discomfort in managing patients with DGBI. Potential interventions will require a multi-pronged and longitudinal approach with education and training initiatives at the trainee level and beyond and exploring systemic healthcare delivery innovations to remove barriers.",

        "Abstract": "Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is a rare clinical finding due to multifocal factors consisting of an ischemic insult to the esophagus, corrosive injury from gastric content, and diminished mucosal defense. It is also referred to as \"black esophagus\" or acute necrotizing esophagitis. The clinical presentation mainly consists of upper gastrointestinal bleed and abdominal pain. Associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia. AEN can be diagnosed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with findings of diffuse circumferential black pigmentation in the distal esophagus that classically extends to the gastroesophageal junction. A diagnostic biopsy is not required but recommended. Treatment of AEN is conservative management to maintain hemodynamic stability and treat coexisting medical conditions. Herein, we present the case of a 78-year-old male who initially presented with hematemesis and abdominal discomfort of five-day duration and was subsequently found to have AEN.",

        "Abstract": "Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is an increasingly common cause of dysphagia in both children and adults, as well as one of the most prevalent oesophageal diseases with a significant impact on physical health and quality of life. We have provided a single comprehensive guideline for both paediatric and adult gastroenterologists on current best practice for the evaluation and management of EoE. The Oesophageal Section of the British Society of Gastroenterology was commissioned by the Clinical Standards Service Committee to develop these guidelines. The Guideline Development Group included adult and paediatric gastroenterologists, surgeons, dietitians, allergists, pathologists and patient representatives. The Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcomes process was used to generate questions for a systematic review of the evidence. Published evidence was reviewed and updated to June 2021. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the evidence and make recommendations. Two rounds of voting were held to assess the level of agreement and the strength of recommendations, with 80% consensus required for acceptance. Fifty-seven statements on EoE presentation, diagnosis, investigation, management and complications were produced with further statements created on areas for future research. These comprehensive adult and paediatric guidelines of the British Society of Gastroenterology and British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition are based on evidence and expert consensus from a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals, including patient advocates and patient support groups, to help clinicians with the management patients with EoE and its complications.",

To characterize leader and trainee gender across US academic IM and to investigate the association of leader gender with trainee gender. Cross-sectional study. Leaders (chairs, chiefs, program directors (PDs)) in 2018 and trainees (residents, fellows) in 2012-2016 at medical school-affiliated IM and seven IM fellowship programs. Leadership (chair/chief and program director; and, for resident analyses, fellow) gender. Our primary outcome was percent women trainees (IM residents and, separately, subspecialty fellows). We used standard statistics to describe leadership and trainee gender. We created separate multivariable linear regressions to evaluate associations of leader gender and percent women fellows with percent women IM residents. We then created separate multivariable multilevel models (site as a random effect) to evaluate associations of leader gender with percent women subspecialty fellows. Our cohort consisted of 940 programs. Women were 13.4% of IM chairs and <25% of chiefs in each fellowship subspecialty (cardiology: 2.6%; gastroenterology: 6.6%; pulmonary and critical care: 10.7%; nephrology: 14.4%; endocrinology: 20.6%; hematology-oncology: 23.2%; infectious diseases: 24.3%). IM PDs were 39.7% women; fellowship PDs ranged from nearly 25% (cardiology and gastroenterology) to nearly 50% (endocrinology and infectious disease) women. Having more women fellows (but not chairs or PDs) was associated with having more women residents (0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.5%) increase per 1% fellow increase, p<0.001); this association remained after adjustment (0.3% (0.1%, 0.4%), p=0.001). In unadjusted analyses, having a woman PD (increase of 7.7% (4.7%, 10.6%), p<0.001) or chief (increase of 8.9% (4.6%, 13.1%), p<0.001) was associated with an increase in women fellows; after adjustment, these associations were lost. Women held a minority of leadership positions in academic IM. Having women leaders was not independently associated with having more women trainees.",

        "Abstract": "Liver cirrhosis is a major global health burden worldwide due to its high risk of morbidity and mortality. Role of terlipressin for the management of liver cirrhosis-related complications has been recognized during recent years. This article aims to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidance on the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications. Hepatobiliary Study Group of the Chinese Society of Gastroenterology of the Chinese Medical Association and Hepatology Committee of the Chinese Research Hospital Association have invited gastroenterologists, hepatologists, infectious disease specialists, surgeons, and clinical pharmacists to formulate the clinical practice guidance based on comprehensive literature review and experts' clinical experiences. Overall, 10 major guidance statements regarding efficacy and safety of terlipressin in liver cirrhosis were proposed. Terlipressin can be beneficial for the management of cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). However, the evidence regarding the use of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with ascites, post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, and bacterial infections and in those undergoing hepatic resection and liver transplantation remains insufficient. Terlipressin-related adverse events, mainly including gastrointestinal symptoms, electrolyte disturbance, and cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events, should be closely monitored. The current clinical practice guidance supports the use of terlipressin for gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and HRS in liver cirrhosis. High-quality studies are needed to further clarify its potential effects in other liver cirrhosis-related complications.",

        "Title": "Venous Thromboembolic Complications in Pediatric Gastrointestinal Diseases: Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Intestinal Failure.",
        "Abstract": "In children with gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intestinal failure (IF), the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased. VTE may lead to pulmonary embolism, sepsis and central line infection, stroke and post-thrombotic syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge and recent advances around VTE management in pediatric gastroenterology with a focus on IBD and IF. The VTE incidence in children with IBD is reported to be around 4-30 per 10,000 patient-years, with higher incidences for hospitalized children. While in general, IF is less common than IBD, the VTE incidence in children with IF is around 750 per 10,000 patient-years. The most common risk factors for development of VTE involve deviations leading to Virchow's triad (endothelial damage, stasis, and hypercoagulability) and include active inflammation, particularly with colonic involvement, presence of a central venous catheter, underlying thrombophilia, reduced mobility, surgery, and hospitalization. Classes of anticoagulants used for treatment of VTE are low molecular weight heparins and vitamin K antagonists. However, the use of direct oral anticoagulants for treatment or prevention of VTE has not been studied in this pediatric population yet. Pediatric gastroenterologists apply different VTE prevention and treatment strategies due to lack of literature and lack of consensus. We discuss the role of primary and secondary prophylactic use of anticoagulants, and provide tools and recommendations for screening, prevention and management for the specific pediatric populations.",

        "Abstract": "Anastomotic leakage (AL) in colorectal resection and primary anastomosis is a common and feared complication. Fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMSs) have been used for the treatment of AL. It is still unknown whether FCSEMSs affect anastomosis healing negatively by causing ischemia. In an animal study, we investigated the metabolic effects over a FCSEMS covering a stapled colon anastomosis. Seven pigs were investigated using microdialysis after laparotomy, colon resection, and anastomosis with stent placement. Measurements were done at the proximal and distal ends of the anastomosis and at a reference catheter placed at the small intestine. Measurements of glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, and the lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P) were carried out. Lactate and L/P were significantly higher at the oral part of the anastomosis, while glucose showed a small declining tendency. At the distal part of the anastomosis, glucose decreased significantly after the resection but did not reach zero. Lactate increased significantly whereas L/P increased only slightly. Glycerol levels were stable. Colon resection caused initially hypermetabolism in the intestinal ends next to the resection site. This hypermetabolism neither deteriorated nor turned into ischemia during the initial postoperative course, but the start of hypoxemia could not be excluded during the study and after the placement of an FCSEMS.",

        "Title": "Current and Future Approaches for Diagnosing Small Intestinal Dysbiosis in Patients With Symptoms of Functional Dyspepsia.",
        "Abstract": "The development and application of next generation sequencing technologies for clinical gastroenterology research has provided evidence that microbial dysbiosis is of relevance for the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. Microbial dysbiosis is characterized as alterations of diversity, function, and density of the intestinal microbes. Emerging evidence suggests that alterations of the gastrointestinal microbiome are important for the pathophysiology of a variety of functional gastrointestinal conditions, e.g., irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), also known as disorders of brain-gut axis interaction. Clinicians have for many years recognized that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is typified by a microbial dysbiosis that is underpinned by abnormal bacterial loads in these sites. SIBO presents with symptoms which overlap with symptoms of FD and IBS, point toward the possibility that SIBO is either the cause or the consequence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). More recently, new terms including \"intestinal methanogen overgrowth\" and \"small intestinal fungal overgrowth\" have been introduced to emphasize the contribution of methane production by archea and fungi in small intestinal dysbiosis. There is emerging data that targeted antimicrobial treatment of SIBO in patients with FD who simultaneously may or may not have IBS, results in symptom improvement and normalization of positive breath tests. However, the association between SIBO and FGIDs remains controversial, since widely accepted diagnostic tests for SIBO are lacking. Culture of jejunal fluid aspirate has been proposed as the \"traditional gold standard\" for establishing the diagnosis of SIBO. Utilizing jejunal fluid culture, the results can potentially be affected by cross contamination from oropharyngeal and luminal microbes, and there is controversy regarding the best cut off values for SIBO diagnosis. Thus, it is rarely used in routine clinical settings. These limitations have led to the development of breath tests, which when compared with the \"traditional gold standard,\" have sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity for SIBO diagnosis. With newer diagnostic approaches-based upon applications of the molecular techniques there is an opportunity to characterize the duodenal and colonic mucosa associated microbiome and associated gut microbiota dysbiosis in patients with various gastrointestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Furthermore, the role of confounders like psychological co-morbidities, medications, dietary practices, and environmental factors on the gastrointestinal microbiome in health and disease also needs to be explored.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric gastrointestinal motility disorders present significant challenges for diagnosis and management, emphasizing the need for appropriate training in Pediatric Neurogastroenterology and Motility (PNGM). The aim of this survey, part of a comprehensive survey on training in pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition, was to evaluate training related to PNGM across European training centers. Standardized questionnaires were collected from training centers through the National Societies Network of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), from June 2016 to December 2019. In total, 100 training centers from 19 countries participated in the survey. Dedicated PNGM clinics were available in 22 centers; pH-monitoring in 60; pH/impedance in 66; standard manometry in 37; and high-resolution manometry in 33. If all motility studies were performed partially or fully by the trainees, the median (range) annual numbers/per trainee were as follows: pH-monitoring 30 (1-500); pH/impedance 17 (1-131); standard manometries 10 (1-150); and high-resolution manometries 8 (1-75). The motility assessment was performed by pediatric gastroenterologists (43 centers); adult gastroenterologists (10 centers); pediatric surgeons (5 centers); and both pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric surgeons (9 centers). Annual numbers ≤10 for pH-monitoring, pH/impedance, standard manometries and high-resolution manometries were reported by 7 (12%), 15 (23%), 11 (30%) and 14 (42%) centers, respectively. Significant differences exist in PNGM-related infrastructure, staff and procedural volumes at training centers across Europe. ESPGHAN and the National Societies should take initiatives to ensure the acquisition of competence in PNGM-related knowledge and skills, and develop strategies for assessment and accreditation.An infographic is available for this article at: http://www.annalsgastro.gr/files/journals/1/earlyview/2022/Infographic-AG6486.pdf.",

        "Abstract": "This survey evaluated the effects of the recognition of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (PGHN) on European PGHN training centers. Standardized questionnaires were collected from training centers via the presidents/representatives of the National Societies Network of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, from June 2016 to December 2019. A total of 100 training centers from 19 countries participated in the survey: 55 from 12 countries where PGHN is formally recognized (Group 1) and 45 from 7 countries where it is not (Group 2). Training centers in Group 2 were less likely to have an integrated endoscopy suite, a written training curriculum and a training lead (P=0.059, P<0.001 and P=0.012, respectively). Trainees in Group 2 were less likely to be exposed to an adequate number of diagnostic endoscopies, while no differences were found in relation to liver biopsies. Half of the training centers in both Groups do not have dedicated beds for PGHN patients, while in 64% and 58%, respectively, trainees do not participate in on-call programs for PGHN emergencies. Research training is mandatory in 26% of the centers. The duration of training, as well as the assessment and accreditation policies, vary between countries. This study has revealed significant discrepancies and gaps in infrastructure and training programs, training leadership, and assessment of training and certification across European training centers in PGHN. Strategies to support the recognition of PGHN and to standardize and improve training conditions should be developed and implemented.An infographic is available for this article at: http://www.annalsgastro.gr/files/journals/1/earlyview/2022/Infographic_AG-6496.pdf.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children. Primary-care physicians (PCPs) play a key role in identifying patients requiring specialist referral. In this study, we aim to determine PCPs' practice patterns for paediatric NAFLD, as knowledge gaps have been reported for adult NAFLD. A survey was sent to 60 PCPs in the Eastern Ontario Network from July 2019 to January 2020. Thirty-seven (62%) PCPs responded to the survey. Twenty-one incorrectly considered the prevalence of paediatric NAFLD to be ≤10%. The majority (35/36) cared for less than five paediatric NAFLD patients. Thirty-four (92%) were only 'slightly familiar' or 'not familiar at all' with paediatric NAFLD. Only one PCP routinely screens for NAFLD. Only one PCP was aware of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) clinical guidelines for paediatric NAFLD. Twenty-five (68%) correctly selected lifestyle modifications as a treatment option. Lack of confidence in the knowledge of NAFLD was the most common barrier for managing paediatric cases. The majority of PCPs are not screening for paediatric NAFLD and are not familiar with its clinical spectrum, citing a lack of knowledge regarding NAFLD as the greatest barrier. This may cause delays in diagnosis and a presentation with advanced fibrosis at the time of specialist referral. Dissemination and implementation of clinical guidelines have the potential to improve knowledge and screening rates for NAFLD in children at the primary-care level.",

We aim to identify the gender-specific barriers of IM residents toward pursuing GI. We surveyed IM residents in the Northeast by emailing 168 IM programs a survey link to be distributed to their residents. A 4-point Likert barrier scale and bivariate analysis were performed with \"yes\" and \"no,\" where \"yes\" was analyzed as \"somewhat of a barrier\" and above. Females received a third table assessing female-specific barriers. Significance was set at < 0.05. Of 215 survey responses, 56.3% (n = 121) were female. Response rate could not be determined due to resident identity protection and inconsistent responses of survey dissemination from programs. Females had significantly greater concerns about fertility, maternity leave, radiation exposure, work-life balance, stress, and burnout compared to males (p < 0.05). For females, 48.7% felt a lack of gender diversity in GI, 54.6% felt a lack of female GI mentors, and 43.7% felt there is a lack of respect as a female in GI. No gender differences existed in motivation to pursue GI, exposure to GI, and access to GI mentors, or GI-related research. Our study reveals that female IM trainees had greater concerns surrounding fertility, radiation exposure, and maternity leave compared to male IM trainees. Lack of gender diversity and lack of female GI mentors were noted barriers for female IM trainees. Addressing these barriers may help increase female representation in GI.",

        "Abstract": "Physical stress is common in GI endoscopists, leading to musculoskeletal disorders. Considering the increasing complexity of interventional GI endoscopy with prolonged examination time, work-related musculoskeletal disorders have come into focus. However, data on work-related health stress in German endoscopists are elusive. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the prevalence and consequences of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in German endoscopists. A 24-item questionnaire on endoscopy-associated musculoskeletal disorders and standardized pain assessment was developed by an interdisciplinary team of endoscopists and sports medics. The survey was distributed online by the leading German societies for gastroenterology and endoscopy. Overall, 151 German practicing endoscopists took part in the study. Regarding the average number of endoscopic procedures per week, the study collective consisted mainly of high-volume endoscopists. The survey showed that most participants suffered from general musculoskeletal disorders (82.8%) and from work-related musculoskeletal disorders (76.8%). The most affected body parts were the neck, low back, thumb, and shoulder. Temporary absence from work due to symptoms was reported by 9.9% of the respondents. Over 30% of participating endoscopists stated the need for analgesics or physiotherapy due to musculoskeletal disorders. Age, professional experience and work time were identified as relevant risk factors for musculoskeletal health issues. A high number of German endoscopists are affected by musculoskeletal disorders due to specific working postures and repetitive movements with a large impact on personal health. Further interventional studies are mandatory to improve the risk prevention of endoscopic activity.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis presents with epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Acute pancreatitis can also present with a pleural effusion which is typically left-sided, mild in nature, and self-limiting. However, recurrent bouts of pancreatitis may lead to a pancreaticopleural fistula (PPF) with a large, rapidly recurring, unilateral pleural effusion. Among patients with PPF, the most common presenting complaint is dyspnea. We present the case of a 53-year-old man with recurrent bouts of pancreatitis in the setting of alcohol who presented with progressively worsening shortness of breath. A high-resolution computed topography scan of the thorax demonstrated a large right-sided pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed with pleural fluid studies showing an exudative effusion with amylase significantly elevated at 18 382 U/L. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed which showed a pancreatic duct leak in the tail of the pancreas. A pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed, and a stent was placed into the ventral pancreatic duct. The patient's shortness of breath improved, and he was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. The aim of this report is to present the diagnosis of a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis and discuss the management and options for treatment.",

An electronic survey was distributed anonymously to all resident physicians in the Core Internal Medicine residency program at the University of Alberta. A similar survey was distributed to staff physicians in the 4 specialties impacted by this new system: hematology, respirology, nephrology and gastroenterology. 74 physicians completed the survey. A majority of respondents (67%) indicated the new system was a positive change. Most shared it was better than traditional 1 in 4 call (65%), with resident physicians appreciating the team based nature of the system (65%), and just more than half of residents (55%) indicating this system improved their overall wellness. Most respondents (78%) did not feel the additional handover required had a negative impact. Respondents indicated daytime teaching and feedback improved as a result of this system (52%) with most others indicating it had no impact, although overnight feedback remained a challenge. The implementation of this new team based system was well accepted by both staff and resident physicians across a number of domains. Future study is required to determine its impact on access and quality of care.",

        "Abstract": "Achalasia is a rare primary esophageal motility disorder disease. It is reported that the long-term effect of fully coated anti-reflux metal stent (FCARMS) implantation is satisfactory. Operated by a skilled and experienced endoscopist, the effect of per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) treatment is equivalent to that of surgical myotomy. So far, there is still few evidence to prove FCARMS implantation or POEM which is better for achalasia. The choice of treatment for achalasia is still controversial. The aim of this study is to find a more suitable therapy for achalasia by comparing the efficacy of FCARMS implantation and POEM. A propensity score (PS) matching (1:2) was used in this retrospective cohort study. Data collected from consecutive patients of Achalasia, receiving FCARMS implantation or POEM therapy at the department of gastroenterology, the Seventh Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital from May 2007 to May 2018. According to their previous treatment, they are divided into two groups, FCARMS group and POEM group. Clinical efficacy and complications were compared between the two groups. A total of 166 cases were collected, including 113 cases of FCARMS and 53 cases of POEM. By PS matching, 150 patients were enrolled (100 cases of FCARMS and 50 cases of POEM). By comparison, the FCARMS group has shorter operation time, shorter fasting time and lower hospitalization costs than the POEM group (p < 0.05). Common complications in the FCARMS group are nausea, vomiting, and stent shift. Repetitions of gastroscopy in the FCARMS group was more often, which were 3.8 ± 2.4 (vs 2.1 ± 1.8 of POEM) (p = 0.00 < 0.05) The 6-month remission rates of the FCARMS combination POEM group were 89% and 94%, respectively (p = 0.39), and the 2-year remission rates were 61% and 90%, respectively (p = 0.00). Stent placement is a cost-effective and safe treatment option for achalasia. The short-term effect (less than 6 months) of FCARMS is similar to that of POEM, the long-term effect (more than 2 years), POEM is better than FCARMS. HRMIIis most suitable for POEM treatment. It indicate that Patients can choose treatment methods according to their own conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) was introduced nearly two decades ago. Initially, it was limited by poor image quality and short battery time, but due to technical improvements, it has become an equal diagnostic alternative to optical colonoscopy (OC). Hastened by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, CCE has been introduced in clinical practice to relieve overburdened endoscopy units and move investigations to out-patient clinics. A wider adoption of CCE would be bolstered by positive patient experience, as it offers a diagnostic investigation that is not inferior to other modalities. The shortcomings of CCE include its inability to differentiate adenomatous polyps from hyperplastic polyps. Solving this issue would improve the stratification of patients for polyp removal. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in polyp detection and characterization to minimize incomplete CCEs and avoid needless examinations. Onboard AI appears to be a needed application to enable near-real-time decision-making in order to diminish patient waiting times and avoid superfluous subsequent OCs. With this letter, we discuss the potential and role of AI in CCE as a diagnostic tool for the large bowel.",

Early symptoms are related to skin and soft tissue involvement (coarse facial features, widening of wrists, etc) and may thus be overlooked unless a careful physical examination is carried out. Secondary causes of pachydermoperiosteitis must always be looked for in such patients. During evaluation, a systemic review of all organ systems should be carried out to identify asymptomatic or subclinical involvement of organ systems and identify means to avoid disease progression. Treatment options are limited to steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the absence of definitive guidelines, clinical decisions are largely case based, with no definite duration of drug therapy or screening of potential malignancies outlined in current literature. Mental health and social rehabilitation of these patients due to their disfiguring deformities are an unmet need.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophages play a crucial role in the inflammatory response to the human stomach pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which infects half of the world's population and causes gastric cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of macrophage immunometabolism in their activation state and function. We have demonstrated that the cysteine-producing enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is upregulated in humans and mice with H. pylori infection. Here, we show that induction of CTH in macrophages by H. pylori promoted persistent inflammation. Cth-/- mice had reduced macrophage and T cell activation in H. pylori-infected tissues, an altered metabolome, and decreased enrichment of immune-associated gene networks, culminating in decreased H. pylori-induced gastritis. CTH is downstream of the proposed antiinflammatory molecule, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Whereas Cth-/- mice exhibited gastric SAM accumulation, WT mice treated with SAM did not display protection against H. pylori-induced inflammation. Instead, we demonstrated that Cth-deficient macrophages exhibited alterations in the proteome, decreased NF-κB activation, diminished expression of macrophage activation markers, and impaired oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Thus, through altering cellular respiration, CTH is a key enhancer of macrophage activation, contributing to a pathogenic inflammatory response that is the universal precursor for the development of H. pylori-induced gastric disease.",

It is essential to assess the immunization status of patients at diagnosis or, if this is not possible, at least before the beginning of immunosuppressive therapy and, subsequently, administering the appropriate vaccines. Therefore, the aim of this work is to establish clear and concise recommendations on vaccination in patients with IBD in the different settings of our clinical practice including vaccination in children, during pregnancy, breastfeeding or on trips. This consensus document emphasises the differences between inactivated and attenuated vaccines and the different degrees of immunosuppression and correlates them with the administration of both mandatory and optional vaccines recommended to our patients with IBD. Finally, as a summary, 17 recommendations are established based on the available scientific evidence and expert opinion.

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common diagnosed cancer among non-Hispanic Black people in the United States. Alarmingly, this population is also 40% more likely to succumb to the disease. Black men get diagnosed younger, present with late-stage disease, and have poor 5-year survival rates. In total, 42% of the racial disparity is due to differences in screening. In Rochester, New York, there are eight zip codes where less than 47% of the population completed CRC screening and six zip codes where men have 15% to 49% above expected cases of CRC. This qualitative improvement project took place in a barbershop in a zip code with subpar screening rates and higher-than-expected cases of CRC. Black men, 45-75 years of age, not current with CRC screening guidelines were recruited to participate after they received barber services. CRC screening was considered complete once a colonoscopy was scheduled. Colorectal cancer education was provided by a nurse practitioner to barbers, who then provided education to their eligible patrons. After the education, patrons who decided to undergo screening were connected to a local gastroenterology group where a colonoscopy was scheduled. Thirteen participants agreed to participate in the project. Nine participants scheduled CRC screening, and seven completed the colonoscopy evaluation. Barbers and nurse practitioners are an ideal partnership when seeking to disrupt the CRC health care disparity. Members of the Black community who may not routinely participate in preventive care can be innovatively educated to improve their health status.",

        "Abstract": "Variants in the UNC45A cochaperone have been recently associated with a syndrome combining diarrhea, cholestasis, deafness, and bone fragility. Yet the mechanism underlying intestinal failure in UNC45A deficiency remains unclear. Here, biallelic variants in UNC45A were identified by next-generation sequencing in 6 patients with congenital diarrhea. Corroborating in silico prediction, variants either abolished UNC45A expression or altered protein conformation. Myosin VB was identified by mass spectrometry as client of the UNC45A chaperone and was found misfolded in UNC45AKO Caco-2 cells. In keeping with impaired myosin VB function, UNC45AKO Caco-2 cells showed abnormal epithelial morphogenesis that was restored by full-length UNC45A, but not by mutant alleles. Patients and UNC45AKO 3D organoids displayed altered luminal development and microvillus inclusions, while 2D cultures revealed Rab11 and apical transporter mislocalization as well as sparse and disorganized microvilli. All those features resembled the subcellular abnormalities observed in duodenal biopsies from patients with microvillus inclusion disease. Finally, microvillus inclusions and shortened microvilli were evidenced in enterocytes from unc45a-deficient zebrafish. Taken together, our results provide evidence that UNC45A plays an essential role in epithelial morphogenesis through its cochaperone function of myosin VB and that UNC45A loss causes a variant of microvillus inclusion disease.",

        "Abstract": "There has been little research in the United Kingdom regarding young people's experiences of disclosure of psychological difficulties relating to coeliac disease (CD) to others, particularly healthcare professionals. This study sought to address this systematically with a focus on the lived experiences of young people with CD. This study aimed to gain insight into how paediatric gastroenterology services could improve the patient experience for those with CD and support the identification of patients who may benefit from further psychological support. This study used interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) of patient accounts. Seven young people with CD (aged 11-16 years) were recruited from a UK hospital paediatric gastroenterology service. Semi-structured interviews were carried out and verbatim transcripts were analysed using IPA to explore young people's experiences of CD and why they might feel able or unable to disclose psychological difficulties associated with their condition to clinicians. Three superordinate themes were interpreted from the data. The first encapsulated experiences of adjusting to the diagnosis within a developmental context, including the role of adults in information provision and the importance of peer support. The second outlined experiences of managing perceived or actual stigma regarding others' perceptions of the condition and themselves. The third incorporated perceived barriers to disclosure relating to power, safety, and beliefs about the role of medical professionals. Findings highlight the importance of clinicians continually providing developmentally appropriate information to young people and actively breaking down barriers to disclosure through body language and the use of clear questions regarding emotional experiences.",

        "Abstract": "This study evaluated the impact of eConsults on access to specialty care for uninsured patients in Central Texas. eConsults for four specialties, cardiology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, and endocrinology, were implemented in a large, multi-site federally qualified health center. Data were collected on specialty care access and utilization for a one-year period before and after implementation of the new process. Prior to implementation, 23% of uninsured patients referred to the included specialties completed a visit with a specialist. After implementation, 62% received a specialty consultation either through an eConsult or with a face-to-face visit. Wait times for referrals improved from a median of 54 days to seven days. This project demonstrated that eConsults improve access and reduce wait times for specialty care for uninsured patients. Interventions such as this have the potential to reduce health inequalities by providing timely access to care for common specialty concerns.",

        "Abstract": "Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a wireless technology used by gastroenterologists for various indications in their clinical practice. There has been significant improvement in this technology since its start about two decades ago. Specific video capsules have been made to evaluate the small bowel, colon, and esophagus. Now pan-enteric video capsule is available to assess both the small bowel and colon. VCE is a non-invasive procedure that has been tremendously evaluated for various gastrointestinal disorders, particularly small intestinal bleeding. There are specific contraindications and complications of VCE. This procedure has the technical part and video reading part. Newer software programs will come to reduce the reading time. Artificial intelligence is also coming for quick and accurate diagnosis of any positive findings during VCE. VCE is an important diagnostic test in the field of gastroenterology. Although it is an addition to optical endoscopic procedures to visualize the gastrointestinal mucosa, it has advantages and disadvantages.",

        "Abstract": "Background Postoperative ileus (POI) is among the most common complications affecting patients who undergo major abdominal surgery. Because of the high volume of major surgery and the high incidence of postoperative ileus, failure to code for this complication may have a significant impact on hospital reimbursement and quality measures. Objectives This paper investigates the magnitude of the difference between the prevalence of POI as coded in administrative data versus the prevalence based upon a prospectively applied operational definition of POI in patients undergoing intestinal resection surgery. Methods Data was collected during the course of a prospective study at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics on an investigational digital health device for predicting operationally defined POI. Following the first 24 hours post-surgery, a patient was identified as experiencing POI as operationally defined by the occurrence of vomiting, reversal of diet and/or placement of a nasogastric tube. For all subjects, billing data was also collected. Results A total of 203 adult patients undergoing intestinal resection surgery consented to participate. Of patients who developed POI based on the operational definition, 35% were not coded accordingly to capture appropriate risk adjustment and reimbursement. Conclusions Patients who experienced indicators of POI but who were not coded experienced over two days of additional time in the hospital compared to patients who did not experience POI, representing significant unreimbursed costs. Timing and duration of POI indicators appear to impact coding discrepancies and may suggest means for improving caregiver identification of POI in a patient's medical record.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an irreversible fibro-inflammatory disease of the pancreas with no current targeted therapy. Pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory drug, is FDA approved for treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Its efficacy in ameliorating CP has never been evaluated before. We recently reported that pirfenidone improves acute pancreatitis in mouse models. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pirfenidone in mouse models of CP. We used caerulein and L-arginine models of CP and administered pirfenidone with ongoing injury, or in well-established disease. We evaluated for fibrosis by Sirius-red staining for collagen, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qPCR for fibrosis markers to show the salutary effects of pirfenidone in CP. Our results suggest that treatment with pirfenidone ameliorated CP related changes in the pancreas (i.e., atrophy, acinar cell loss, fibrosis, and inflammation) not only when administered with ongoing injury, but also in well-established models of caerulein as well as L-arginine induced CP. It reduces the pro-fibrotic phenotype of macrophages (in-vivo and in-vitro), reduces macrophage infiltration into the pancreas and alters the intra-pancreatic cytokine milieu preceding changes in histology. The therapeutic effect of pirfenidone is abrogated in absence of macrophages. Furthermore, it reduces collagen secretion, cytokine levels and fibrosis markers in pancreatic stellate cells in-vitro. As it is FDA approved, our findings in mouse models simulating clinical presentation of patients to the clinic, can be used as the basis of a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of this drug as a therapeutic agent for CP.",

        "Abstract": "Monitoring nutritional intake is of clinical value, but few existing tools offer electronic dietary recording, instant nutritional analysis, and a platform connecting healthcare teams with patients that provides timely, personalised support. This feasibility randomised controlled trial tests the usability of 'myfood24 Healthcare', a dietary assessment app and healthcare professional website, in two clinical populations. Patients were recruited from a weight management programme (n21) and from a group of gastroenterology surgery outpatients (<i>n</i> = 27). They were randomised into three groups: standard care, myfood24, or myfood24 + diet optimisation (automated suggestions for dietary improvement). The participants were asked to record their diet at least four times over eight weeks. During the study, healthcare professionals viewed recorded dietary information to facilitate discussions about diet and nutritional targets. The participants provided feedback on usability and acceptability. A total of 48 patients were recruited, and 16 were randomised to each of the three groups. Compliance among app users (<i>n</i> = 32) was reasonable, with 25 (78%) using it at least once and 16 (50%) recording intake for four days or more. Among users, the mean (standard deviation) number of days used was 14.0 (17.5), and the median (interquartile range) was six (2.5-17.0) over 2 months. Feedback questionnaires were completed by only 23 of 46 participants (50%). The mean System Usability Score (<i>n</i> = 16) was 59 (95% confidence interval, 48-70). Patient and healthcare professional feedback indicates a need for more user training and the improvement of some key app features such as the food search function. This feasibility study shows that myfood24 Healthcare is acceptable for patients and healthcare professionals. These data will inform app refinements and its application in a larger clinical effectiveness trial.",

        "Title": "An Outstanding Role of Adipose Tissue in Canine Stem Cell Therapy.",
        "Abstract": "Adipose tissue, previously known as connective tissue with a role in energy storage, is currently changing the course of treatments in veterinary medicine. Recent studies have revealed one particularly impressive function among all the newly discovered functions of adipose tissue. The interactive cells hosted by adipose tissue, the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), and their role in treating numerous diseases have provided a prospective course of research with positive outcomes in regenerative veterinary medicine (RVM). This review describes the main features of adipose tissue, emphasizing an eclectic combination of cells within the SVF and its thus far researched therapeutic possibilities in canine RVM. An afterwards focus is on a highly researched component of the SVF, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), which were shown to have an extraordinary impact relying on several proposed mechanisms of action on mitigating pathologies in canines. Furthermore, ASC therapy showed the most significant results in the orthopaedics field and in neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, and hepatology, which elevates the possibilities of ASC therapy to a whole new level. Therefore, this review article aims to raise awareness of the importance of research on cellular components, within abundant and easily accessible adipose tissue, in the direction of regenerative therapy in canines, considering the positive outcomes so far. Although the focus is on the positive aspects of cellular therapy in canines, the researchers should not forget the importance of identifying the potential negative aspects within published and upcoming research. Safe and standardized treatment represents a fundamental prerequisite for positively impacting the lives of canine patients.",

The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) published (2012) and updated (2020) diagnostic criteria for CD in order to simplify CD diagnosis and to avoid biopsies in selected patients. A prospective study including 5641 pediatric patients (0-16 years old) from January 2012 to January 2019 was performed. CD diagnosis was made according to the ESPGHAN algorithm. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of biomarkers and the relationship between TGA-IgA and EMA titers. CD diagnoses were confirmed in 113 patients, 110 were IgA-TG2-positive and 3 (2.7%) had IgA deficiency. The diagnosis was made by serologic tests in 95 (84.1%) patients. Only 18 (15.9%) patients underwent intestinal biopsy. We obtained 100% concordance between IgA-EMA and positive results for IgA-TG2 ≥ 10 ULN with IgA-EMA antibody titer ≥ 1:80. This study provides evidence of a positive correlation between IgA-TG2 antibody serum levels and IgA-EMA. The diagnosis could be guaranteed with strict application of IgA-TG2 values ≥ 10 ULN (confirmed by subsequent testing) plus the serological response to the gluten-free diet (GFD).",

        "Abstract": "The aims of the study were (1) to determine how frequently patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with CVS-related symptoms, (2) to identify variables in clinical presentation that occur frequently in patients with multiple ED visits, and (3) to compare ED management of CVS with recommended guidelines. This study is a retrospective chart review of all ED visits for CVS between April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2018, at a single center. Patients were identified from a master list of patients diagnosed with CVS in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic at the same center between June 1, 2004, and June 19, 2018. Of the 181 CVS clinic patients identified, 65 had visited to the ED (35.9%). Two hundred twenty-eight visits met inclusion criteria. A total of 42.5% of these visits were made by a small number of high-intensity patients (n = 6) who had an average of 16.1 visits each. These patients represented less than 10% of the total patient group. Patients with frequent visits had longer visits (536.52 vs 380.55 minutes), more frequent hospital admissions (57.73% vs 29.01%), and more visits to the ED before a formal diagnosis of CVS was made (5.83 vs 1.22), but few other distinguishing characteristics. Only 27% of eligible visits were managed with an available order set, and management varied from recommended guidelines. An ambiguous presentation makes the identification and consistent management of CVS in the ED difficult. Physicians should consider CVS for patients who present multiple times with unremitting vomiting to ensure appropriate referral for diagnosis and prophylactic treatment. Future studies are warranted to evaluate anticipatory processing and treatment of the \"high-intensity patients\" who account for much of the clinical morbidity and resource utilization.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of biologic drugs revolutionised the treatment of many chronic inflammatory diseases in rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology. The introduction of different targeted agents closely followed the increase in knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms. The identification of IL-23 as a master regulator of 'pathogenic' inflammation and the consequent efficacy of IL-23 blocking agents were first proofed in psoriasis and then in other inflammatory diseases such as psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease. We reviewed all available results from anti-Il-23 clinical trials for psoriasis, focusing on data of IBDologists' interest. Regarding guselkumab, we analysed data from phase III clinical trials VOYAGE1, VOYAGE2, and NAVIGATE. For risankizumab, we reported efficacy and safety results from UltIMMa-1, UltIMMa-2, and IMMvent clinical trials, and tildrakizumab was evaluated by analysing data from reSURFACE1 and reSURFACE2 studies. Data from all the clinical trials that we reported showed both the efficacy of all three anti-IL-23 drugs in psoriasis and the safety of this class; in particular, no gastrointestinal side effects were observed in those studies. IL-23 blockers have shown promising short- and long-term results in psoriasis, with a major safety profile and no negative interactions with gastrointestinal system. Anti-IL-23 indication for psoriatic arthritis is very recent and for IBD is still to come. Therefore, dermatologists are accumulating long-term experience with these drugs, both in clinical trials and in real-world evidence, which can help gastroenterologists in the management of IBD patients.",

        "Abstract": "Evaluating the usefulness of intestinal anti-transglutaminase IgA (anti-TG2 IgA) deposits detection as a complementary or decision-supporting tool in the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) in patients with low degree of enteropathy. Small intestinal biopsies (SIB) were performed from 2008 to 2017 in patients on suspicion of CD (positive CD serology and/or symptoms) referred to our Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit. We determined anti-TG2 IgA deposits by using double immunofluorescence in all the patients in whom Marsh 0 or Marsh 1 was detected in the conventional histological study and in a random selection of patients with clearly positive serology and histological Marsh 2-3 lesion. Seventy-five pediatric patients were split into three groups according to the final diagnosis: (i) 13 children with a Marsh 0 or 1, negative CD serology and final non-CD diagnosis; none presented intestinal anti-TG2 IgA deposits; (ii) 15 potential CD cases (Marsh 0 or 1 and CD-associated antibodies), detecting anti-TG2 IgA deposits in 12; on follow-up, another biopsy performed in 11/15 showed villi atrophy in seven and a Marsh 2 lesion in two of them, patients being finally diagnosed as CD cases; and (iii) 47 children with Marsh 2-3 histological lesion and final CD diagnosis; all of them had intestinal anti-TG2 IgA deposits. Anti-TG2 deposits are a useful complementary tool for CD diagnosis in pediatric population with digestive pathologies suggestive of CD. It is especially helpful in those with low-grade lesion, in which anti-TG2 deposits are predictive of the development of more severe lesions on follow-up.",

        "Abstract": "Endocytoscopy (ECS) aids early gastric cancer (EGC) diagnosis by visualization of cells. However, it is difficult for non-experts to accurately diagnose EGC using ECS. In this study, we developed and evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system for ECS-aided EGC diagnosis. We constructed a CNN based on a residual neural network with a training dataset comprising 906 images from 61 EGC cases and 717 images from 65 noncancerous gastric mucosa (NGM) cases. To evaluate diagnostic ability, we used an independent test dataset comprising 313 images from 39 EGC cases and 235 images from 33 NGM cases. The test dataset was further evaluated by three endoscopists, and their findings were compared with CNN-based results. The trained CNN required 7.0 s to analyze the test dataset. The area under the curve of the total ECS images was 0.93. The CNN produced 18 false positives from 7 NGM lesions and 74 false negatives from 28 EGC lesions. In the per-image analysis, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 83.2%, 76.4%, 92.3%, 93.0%, and 74.6%, respectively, with the CNN and 76.8%, 73.4%, 81.3%, 83.9%, and 69.6%, respectively, for the endoscopist-derived values. The CNN-based findings had significantly higher specificity than the findings determined by all endoscopists. In the per-lesion analysis, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the CNN-based findings were 86.1%, 82.1%, 90.9%, 91.4%, and 81.1%, respectively, and those of the results calculated by the endoscopists were 82.4%, 79.5%, 85.9%, 86.9%, and 78.0%, respectively. Compared with three endoscopists, our CNN for ECS demonstrated higher specificity for EGC diagnosis. Using the CNN in ECS-based EGC diagnosis may improve the diagnostic performance of endoscopists.",

        "Abstract": "Sapovirus causes acute gastroenteritis (AGE) which manifests as severe diarrhea and vomiting. It is most often seen in, but not limited to, children and toddlers but can occur in people of all ages. It is typically more prevalent in low to middle-income countries but has also been reported in progressive countries such as the United States. Due to the universal use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, the reported incidence of sapovirus has continued to grow as the culprit agent in both AGE outbreaks and isolated cases. Its symptoms resemble what is seen with rotavirus but with a milder clinical course. This discussion explores the dire implications of a relatively understated pathogen. Here, we present a rare case of a 20-year-old woman who presented with septic shock secondary to severe gastroenteritis as a result of sapovirus infection.",

        "Abstract": "Ophthalmic conditions including anterior uveitis (AU), episcleritis and scleritis may occur in association with the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) as ophthalmic extraintestinal manifestations. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of a later IBD diagnosis in those presenting with IBD associated ocular inflammation (IAOI). Retrospective cohort study. Primary care UK database. 38 805 subjects with an IAOI were identified (median age 51 (38-65), 57% women) and matched to 153 018 subjects without IAOI. The risk of a subsequent diagnosis of IBD in subjects with IAOIs compared with age/sex matched subjects without IAOI. HRs were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, deprivation, comorbidity, smoking, baseline axial arthropathy, diarrhoea, loperamide prescription, anaemia, lower gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain.Logistic regression was used to produce a prediction model for a diagnosis of IBD within 3 years of an AU diagnosis. 213 (0.6%) subsequent IBD diagnoses (102 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 111 Crohn's disease (CD)) were recorded in those with IAOIs and 329 (0.2%) (215 UC and 114 CD) in those without. Median time to IBD diagnosis was 882 (IQR 365-2043) days in those with IAOI and 1403 (IQR 623-2516) in those without. The adjusted HR for a subsequent diagnosis of IBD was 2.25 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.68), p<0.001; for UC 1.65 (95% CI 1.30 to 2.09), p<0.001; and for CD 3.37 (95% CI 2.59 to 4.40), p<0.001 in subjects with IAOI compared with those without.Within 3 years of an AU diagnosis, 84 (0.5%) subjects had a recorded diagnosis of IBD. The prediction model performed well with a C-statistic of 0.75 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.80). Subjects with IAOI have a twofold increased risk of a subsequent IBD diagnosis. Healthcare professionals should be alert for potential signs and symptoms of IBD in those presenting with ophthalmic conditions associated with IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Liver transplantation (LT) is the curative therapy for decompensated cirrhosis. However, anesthesiologists can find it challenging to manage patients undergoing LT due to the underlying pathologic conditions of patients with end-stage liver disease and the high invasiveness of the procedure, which is frequently accompanied by massive blood loss. Echocardiography is a non-invasive or semi-invasive imaging tool that provides real-time information about the structural and functional status of the heart and is considered to be able to improve outcomes by enabling accurate and detailed assessments. This article reviews the pathophysiologic changes of the heart accompanied by cirrhosis that mainly affect hemodynamics. We also present a comparative review of the diagnostic criteria for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy published by the World Congress of Gastroenterology in 2005 and the Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy Consortium in 2019. This article discusses the conditions that could affect hemodynamic stability and postoperative outcomes, such as coronary artery disease, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, portopulmonary hypertension, hepatopulmonary syndrome, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, patent foramen ovale, and ascites. Finally, we cover a number of intraoperative factors that should be considered, including intraoperative blood loss, rapid reaccumulation of ascites, manipulation of the inferior vena cava, post-reperfusion syndrome, and adverse effects of excessive fluid infusion and transfusion. This article aimed to summarize the cardiovascular manifestations of cirrhosis that can affect hemodynamics and can be evaluated using perioperative echocardiography. We hope that this article will provide information about the hemodynamic characteristics of LT recipients and stimulate more active use of perioperative echocardiography.",

        "Abstract": "Abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a dominant bacterium of the human microbiota that exhibits antiinflammatory effects, is decreased in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In humans, colonic lamina propria contains IL-10-secreting, Foxp3- Tregs characterized by a double expression of CD4 and CD8α (DP8α) and a specificity for F. prausnitzii. This Treg subset is decreased in IBD. The in vivo effect of DP8α cells has not been evaluated yet to our knowledge. Here, using a humanized model of a NSG immunodeficient mouse strain that expresses the HLA D-related allele HLA-DR*0401 but not murine class II (NSG-Ab° DR4) molecules, we demonstrated a protective effect of a HLA-DR*0401-restricted DP8α Treg clone combined with F. prausnitzii administration in a colitis model. In a cohort of patients with IBD, we showed an independent association between the frequency of circulating DP8α cells and disease activity. Finally, we pointed out a positive correlation between F. prausnitzii-specific DP8α Tregs and the amount of F. prausnitzii in fecal microbiota in healthy individuals and patients with ileal Crohn's disease.",

        "Abstract": "For the first 6 months of the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the hospital medicine procedure service at our center was temporarily unavailable. We assessed paracentesis rates and clinical outcomes for patients admitted with cirrhosis and ascites before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two hundred and twenty-four and 131 patients with cirrhosis and ascited were admitted to hospital before and during COVID-19 respectively. Approximately 50.9% and 49.6% of patients underwent a paracentesis within 24 h pre- and mid-pandemic, p = .83. No differences were observed for length-of-stay or 30-day readmissions. GI consultation was associated with higher rates of paracentesis in both eras (p < .001 pre-COVID-19, and p = .01 COVID-19). Changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in changes to rates of timely paracentesis in patients admitted with cirrhosis and ascites. While involvement of gastroenterology may increase rates of paracentesis, further efforts are needed to optimize rates of timely paracentesis to positively impact clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a very common pediatric disease, with strong implications for children and their families. We aimed to determine their frequency in our environment (per Rome IV criteria) and to establish if there is seasonal variability in diagnosis. Descriptive, prospective study. For 12 months, children under 16 years of age with suspected FGIDs who had a first pediatric gastroenterology consultation were included and classified according to Rome IV criteria. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS v22. 574 children received consultations, 67% were >4 years of age. FGIDs were suspected in 44.6% of the patients, 32.4% were diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria (16.4% <4 years, 40.3% >4 years). 51.1% were female, average age of 8.4 ± 4.2 years and mean of 7 months of symptoms until diagnosis (range 3-150). In patients <4 years, the most common disorders were functional constipation (48.4%), regurgitation (22.5%) and functional diarrhea (16.1%); in patients >4 years of age, functional abdominal pain (29%), functional dyspepsia (28.4%) and functional constipation (16.8%) were most frequent. We didn't discern seasonal variations in diagnosis in the global study population (p = 0.96) or by age group (<4 p = 0.51; >4 p = 0.57). FGIDs account for one third of our patients' consultations. While the Rome IV criteria are more inclusive than before, almost 30% of patients with suspected FGIDs don't meet said criteria. Although a seasonal difference regarding diagnosis was observed, it wasn't statistically significant either in the sample group as a whole or by age group.",

        "Abstract": "Infants are frequently exposed to antibiotics (AB) in the first week of life for suspected bacterial infections. Little is known about the effect of AB on the developing intestinal microbiota. Therefore, we studied intestinal microbiota development with and without AB exposure in the first week of life in term born infants. We analysed the faecal microbiota from birth until 2.5 years of age by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in a cohort with 56 term born infants, exposed to AB in the first week of life (AB+) (AB for 2-3 days (AB2, n=20), AB for 7 days (AB7, n=36)), compared with 126 healthy controls (AB-). The effects of AB and duration were examined in relation to delivery and feeding mode. AB+ was associated with significantly increased relative abundance of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> at 3 weeks and 1 year and a decrease of <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, from 1 week until 3 months of age only in vaginally delivered, but not in C-section born infants. Similar deviations were noted in AB7, but not in AB2. After AB, breastfed infants had lower relative abundance of potentially pathogenic <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> compared with formula fed infants and recovered 2 weeks faster towards controls. AB exposure in the first week of life alters faecal microbiota development with deviations in the relative abundance of individual taxa until 1 year of age. These alterations can have long-term health consequences, which emphasises the need for future studies aiming at restoring intestinal microbiota after AB administration.",

        "Abstract": "Acute COVID-19 in pediatric and young adult patients tends to be milder in severity compared to adult infection. Recent studies seem to show that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at no greater risk than the general population. We aim to describe our experience in the follow-up of pediatric and young adult patients with IBD followed in our center and determine possible risk factors of said population for severe COVID-19. We performed a retrospective study of all patients aged under 25 years followed for IBD at the Unit of Pediatric Gastroenterology in a tertiary center between December 2019 and April 2021 evaluating the incidence of COVID-19 and characterization of positive cases. Of the 268 participants, 24 had COVID-19: the mean age was 19 years old and gender had an equal distribution; 75% (<i>n</i> = 18) had Crohn's disease, whereas only 25% (<i>n</i> = 6) had ulcerative colitis. Most patients were in clinical remission (<i>n</i> = 21). The majority of patients were under treatment with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist (58%, <i>n</i> = 14), mainly infliximab, and most had no comorbidities other than IBD (83%). Regarding COVID-19, 17% of the patients were asymptomatic while the rest had only mild symptoms. There were no reported gastrointestinal complaints, no complications nor hospitalizations. Most patients did not require interruption of their IBD treatment. Our data suggest that pediatric and young adult IBD patients have a low risk for complications and hospitalization, regardless of IBD treatment. We believe that this experience is encouraging and allows for safe counseling regarding treatment options and school attendance in pediatric and young adult IBD patients.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the influencing factors for the quality of bowel preparation before colonoscopy in children and the association of the interval from the last administration of laxative to the start of colonoscopy (shortly referred to as waiting time) with the quality of bowel preparation. A retrospective analysis was performed for the children who were admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, from January to November 2020, and received bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder combined with diet control before colonoscopy. According to the score of Boston bowel preparation scale, they were divided into two groups: adequate bowel preparation group (<i>n</i>=337) and inadequate bowel preparation group (<i>n</i>=30). Related data were collected from the children in both groups, including general information, possible influencing factors for the quality of bowel preparation, adverse reactions associated with bowel preparation, duration of colonoscopy, and postoperative diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the influencing factors for the quality of bowel preparation. The univariate analysis showed that age, body weight, and waiting time were associated with inadequate bowel preparation (<i>P</i><0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that older age (<i>OR</i>=2.155, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.087-4.273, <i>P</i>=0.028) and longer waiting time (<i>OR</i>=1.559, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.191-2.041, <i>P</i>=0.001) were independent risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the cut-off value of waiting time was 5.5 hours in determining whether bowel preparation was adequate or not, with a sensitivity of 90.0%, a specificity of 50.7%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.708. After grouping based on waiting time, it was found that the incidence rate of inadequate bowel preparation in the ≥5.5 hours group was significantly higher than that in the <5.5 hours group [14.0% (27/193) <i>vs</i> 1.7% (3/174), <i>P</i><0.001]. For children who use polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder combined with diet control for bowel preparation, older age is an independent risk factor for inadequate bowel preparation before colonoscopy, which may be associated with an insufficient dose of polyethylene glycol in older children. Longer waiting time is also an independent risk factor for inadequate bowel preparation, and it is recommended that the waiting time should not exceed 5.5 hours.",

        "Abstract": "Endoscopy is a rapidly developing discipline with new techniques and procedures being introduced each year. The consenting process is central to patient perception; using information videos as additional tools to aid consent and improve the quality of care in endoscopy is not well established. Our aim was to develop, implement and validate the use of patient educational videos to improve patients' satisfaction and experience in endoscopy. This was a prospective service quality improvement study. Eligible patients were invited to watch the educational videos in addition to standard practice. We compared this group with a matched cohort of patients who were receiving standard care of postal information leaflets. Patient satisfaction was measured through the validated Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Satisfaction Questionnaire (GESQ). Patients in the intervention group scored four questions relating to pre-procedural information significantly higher than the control (p=0.038). The total mean GESQ score was also higher in the intervention group compared to the control, however this was not statistically significant (p=0.397). The intervention group had significantly lower cancellation rate (4%) compared to the control group (20%), p=0.023. Patients who watched educational videos were more satisfied with pre-procedural information in the consenting period than those who did not. Further research is still needed to determine if they reduce patient anxiety. Meanwhile, it would be appropriate to implement these videos into routine practice as a cost-effective method of improving patient satisfaction.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are the most common types of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with variable responses to traditional therapies and unpredicted prognosis. In Egypt and most developing countries, the lack of recent epidemiological and prognostic data adversely affects management strategies. We collected and analyzed data of patients with IBD from multiple centers across Egypt to evaluate patients' clinical and epidemiological characteristics. This retrospective multicenter study included patients diagnosed with IBD between May 2018 and August 2021, at 14 tertiary gastroenterology units across Egypt. Record analysis addressed a combination of clinico-epidemiological characteristics, biochemical tests, stool markers, endoscopic features, histological information, and different lines for IBD treatment. We identified 1104 patients with an established diagnosis of IBD; 81% of them had UC, and 19% showed CD. The mean age of onset was 35.1 ± 12.5 years ranging from 5 to 88 years, the mean duration of illness at inclusion was 13.6 ± 16.7 years, gender distribution was almost equal with a significant male dominance (60.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.003) among patients with CD, 57% were living in rural areas, and 70.5% were from Delta and Coastal areas. Two hundred nineteen patients (19.8%) displayed comorbid conditions, primarily associated with CD. The most frequent complaints were diarrhea (73.2%), rectal bleeding (54.6%) that was significantly higher among patients with UC (64%, <i>p</i> < <i>0.001</i>), and 46.8% with abdominal pain (more often with CD: 71%, <i>p</i> < <i>0.001</i>). Conventional therapy was effective in treating 94.7% of patients. The main lesion in patients with CD was ileal (47.8%); patients with UC mainly exhibited proctosigmoiditis (28.4%). Dysplasia was detected in 7.2% of patients, mainly subjects with UC. To our knowledge, our effort is the first and largest cohort of Egyptian patients with IBD to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics, and diagnostic and management approaches. More extensive prospective studies are still needed to fully characterize disease distribution, environmental factors, and pathological features of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Rectal suction biopsy (RSB) is a gold standard for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease (HD). Calretinin staining of RSB is increasingly used by experienced pathologists due to non-complex examination and comparable diagnostic accuracy with acetylcholinesterase (AChE). However, the diagnostic accuracy of calretinin examined by unexperienced pathologists remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to compare diagnostic accuracy of calretinin with AChE on RSB for diagnosing HD when examined by unexperienced pathologists. We prospectively analyzed sections from RSB stained with AChE + HE and calretinin. Blinded examination was done by five unexperienced pathologists (pathology residents) and three experienced pathologists (senior pediatric gastro-enterology pathologists) assessing for the presence of HD. Cases for the study included ones proven to be HD on resection specimens and cases without HD. Diagnostic accuracy was determined calculating area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, and posttest probability. Fleiss' kappa analysis was performed to assess interobserver agreement between reviewers. Eleven of 18 included patients (61%) were diagnosed with HD. Comparing the diagnostic accuracy of unexperienced pathologists, calretinin versus AChE + HE showed sensitivity of 80.0% versus 74.5% and specificity of 100% versus 65.4%, AUC of 0.87 (0.78-0.96) versus 0.59 (0.45-0.72). Unexperienced pathologists showed substantial agreement with calretinin (kappa 0.72 [0.61-0.84]) and fair agreement with AChE + HE (kappa 0.34 [0.23-0.44]). We found calretinin having higher diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing HD compared to AChE + HE when examined by unexperienced pathologists. Therefore, we recommend to use calretinin as the standard technique for staining RSB in diagnosing HD.",

        "Abstract": "Management of short-bowel syndrome with intestinal failure (SBS-IF) is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Because of the rarity of SBS-IF, healthcare professionals (HCPs) often lack clinical experience with the disease and may benefit from education regarding SBS-IF and its management. This study identified unmet educational needs related to the management of patients with SBS-IF. This was a prospective, web-based survey (December 2019-January 2020) in which a series of clinical questions were posed to US HCPs after presenting three standardized SBS-IF cases to assess current practice patterns. HCPs were then asked a series of questions to identify potential knowledge gaps and unmet educational needs relating to SBS-IF management. Overall, 558 HCPs completed the survey, with 12%-38% having a formal SBS-IF multidisciplinary team currently available to make treatment decisions within their institution. Clinicians involved in care included gastroenterologists (93%), registered dietitians (79%), gastroenterology nurse practitioners and physician assistants (37%), registered nurses (43%), social workers (45%), and psychologists/psychiatrists (27%). There was underuse of published guidelines and limited understanding of the course of intestinal adaptation. Responses to the clinical scenarios highlighted disparities in SBS-IF care delivery, including diagnosis, management goals, medications prescribed, and nutrition practices. Future SBS-IF educational interventions for HCPs should aim to improve awareness and understanding of the disease, facilitate timely diagnosis, and standardize management practices to ensure patients receive optimal interdisciplinary care as widely as possible.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignant disease with a high rate of vascular invasion. (Bruix et al. in Gastroenterology 150:835-853, 2016; Xia et al. in Oncol Lett 20:101, 2020) The conventional surgical strategy for HCC with inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus is open major surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, combined with large trauma. (Liu et al. in Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 24:186-194, 2012; Bai et al. in J Oncol 2020:3264079, 2020) We report a video of laparoscopic hemihepatectomy and thrombectomy without bypass. As far as we are aware, this is the first report on IVC thrombectomy using a minimally invasive surgical technique. A 52-year-old male was admitted to our institution for a giant hepatic mass in the right liver combined with IVC tumor thrombosis. After 2 months of preoperative systemic treatment, the tumor had reduced to 8 cm and the enhancement of tumor thrombosis in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was significantly reduced. We used laparoscopy combined with thoracoscopy to perform the surgery, with the patient placed in the supine position. The abdominal trocar position is shown in Fig. 1b. First, we set the blocking band of the suprahepatic IVC in the thoracoscopy. Infrahepatic IVC occlusion and the Pringle maneuver device were prepared for laparoscopy. After fully exposing the retrohepatic IVC, we performed a thrombectomy and IVC suture completely in laparoscopy. Finally, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation. Fig. 1 a Three-dimensional reconstruction model of the patient (a giant hepatic mass and tumor thrombosis extending to the suprahepatic IVC). b Trocar position for the laparoscopic surgery. The patient was placed in the supine position, and the 5, 6, and 7 intercostal axillary fronts were set for the thoracoscopic trocar, while the remaining five abdominal trocars were set for laparoscopic operation. c Retrohepatic IVC before being cut open. The fullness indicates the position of the tumor thrombosis. d Thrombectomy and suture of the IVC.

HCC was confirmed in histopathology. Laparoscopic hepatectomy with IVC thrombectomy is a possible operation for HCC combined with IVC tumor thrombus, offering hope for minimally invasive treatment of such cases; however, it is still a highly challenging procedure.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 and has proven efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in adult patients with moderate-to-severe UC. In the Symptom Improvement of ulceRative colitis after an Induction dose of Ustekinumab study, we will document the initial treatment response (daily patient-reported outcomes for 8 weeks from first infusion) and treatment patterns of patients wih UC receiving an induction dose of ustekinumab in the real-world setting in Japan. We will also investigate the relationship between the treatment response at week 8 and early indicators of response and determine patient factors that may define the appropriate dosing interval for maintenance therapy. For this single-arm, prospective observational study at 24 centres in Japan with a follow-up period of 16/20 weeks, we aim to recruit 140 patients with moderate-to-severe UC between July 2021 and July 2022. All surveys will be conducted in Japanese and patient-reported outcomes relating to rectal bleeding, stool frequency, abdominal pain, nocturnal diarrhoea, tenesmus and perception of UC symptoms will be recorded using a smartphone application, where the patients can enter their initial response to ustekinumab induction therapy on a daily basis. Dosing intervals and the reasons for selecting this interval, and concomitant medications taken during treatment with ustekinumab will be collected by a physician questionnaire at the end of the study. On completion of primary end point (8-week patient-reported outcomes) data collection, results will be reported sequentially. The study has been approved by the ethics committee of each facility involved and the Institutional Review Board of the non-profit organisation MINS. UMIN000043753, NCT04963725.",

        "Abstract": "Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR) is the retrograde flow of gastric or duodenal contents into the pharynx and larynx, causing inflammation in the upper aerodigestive tract. Traditionally, a pH monitoring study with an acid reflux index was used. The use of multichannel intraluminal impedance testing with pH monitoring (MII-pH) confirms a causal relationship between suspicious symptoms and LPR. To evaluate LPR diagnosed by MII-pH in the pediatric population consulting due to chronic dysphonia and laryngoscopic findings suggestive of LPR, in addition, to measure the concordance between MII-pH and traditional pH monitoring. Descriptive, prospective study of patients consulting at the Gastroenterology or Otorhinolaryngology polyclinic due to chronic dysphonia, whose nasofibrolaryngoscopy (NFL) was suggestive of LPR. The patients were hospitalized for a 24-hour MII-pH. Patients with a congenital or acquired morbid history were excluded. Pathological LPR was considered if there were 3 or more acid reflux episodes at the pro ximal level in MII-pH. The frequency of traditional pH monitoring and altered MII-pH and the concordance between both methods were evaluated. 12 patients were recruited, 10 men, 6 to 15 years old. On 9/12, pathological LPR was confirmed by MII-pH, of which 2/9 had traditional pH measurements in normal ranges and 7/9 altered pH measurements. In 3 patients, LPR was ruled out by normal proximal MII-pH. The concordance between MII-pH and traditional pH monitoring was acceptable (kappa 0.4). 75% of the patients with dysphonia and suggestive NFL showed objective evidence of pathological LPR. Since only with the clinical evaluation, NFL and conventional pH monitoring it is not possible to diagnose LPR, we recommend perform MII-pH for greater diag nostic certainty, avoiding unnecessary treatment, and with unwanted effects in 25% of cases.",

To develop an extension of AGREE II specifically designed for guidelines of surgical interventions. In the tripartite Guideline Assessment Project (GAP) funded by United European Gastroenterology and the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, (i) we assessed the quality of surgical guidelines and we identified factors associated with higher quality (GAP I); (ii) we applied correlation analysis, factor analysis and the item response theory to inform an adaption of AGREE II for the purposes of surgical guidelines (GAP II); and (iii) we developed an AGREE II extension for surgical interventions, informed by the results of GAP I, GAP II, and a Delphi process of stakeholders, including representation from interventional and surgical disciplines; the Guideline International Network (GIN); the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group; the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) initiative; and representation of surgical journal editors and patient/public. We developed AGREE-S, an AGREE II extension for surgical interventions, which comprises 24 items organized in 6 domains; Scope and purpose, Stakeholders, Evidence synthesis, Development of recommendations, Editorial independence, and Implementation and update. The panel of stakeholders proposed 3 additional items: development of a guideline protocol, consideration of practice variability and surgical/interventional expertise in different settings, and specification of infrastructures required to implement the recommendations. Three of the existing items were amended, 7 items were rearranged among the domains, and one item was removed. The domain Rigour of Development was divided into domains on Evidence Synthesis and Development of Recommendations. The new domain Development of Recommendations incorporates items from the original AGREE II domain Clarity of Presentation. AGREE-S is an evidence-based and stakeholder-informed extension of the AGREE II instrument, that can be used as a guide for the development and adaption of guidelines on surgical interventions.",

        "Abstract": "To assess the feasibility considerations for a decentralised, one-stop-shop model of care implemented in Yangon, Myanmar. Two primary care level clinics in urban Yangon, Myanmar. This is a feasibility study of a highly effective care model. Using Intervention Complexity Framework by Gericke <i>et al</i>, we collated and analysed programmatic data and evaluation data to outline key project implementation requirements and experiences. Programmatic data were collected from clinical records, GeneXpert device test and maintenance reports, national guidelines, product and device instructions and site monitoring visit reports. Healthcare providers involved in delivering care model contributed interview data. The main feasibility considerations are appropriate storage for test kits and treatments (in response to temperature and humidity requirements), installation of a continuous stable electricity supply for the GeneXpert device, air-conditioning for the laboratory room hosting GeneXpert, access to a laboratory for pretreatment assessments and clear referral pathways for specialist consultation when required. Lessons from our project implementation experiences included the extensive time requirements for patient education, the importance of regular error monitoring and stock storage reviews and that flexible appointment scheduling and robust reminder system likely contributed to high retention in care. Detailed documentation and dissemination of feasibility requirements and implementation considerations is vital to assist others to successfully implement a similar model of care elsewhere. We provide 10 recommendations for successful implementation. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03939013 on May 6, 2019. This manuscript presents post-results data on feasibility.",

        "Abstract": "Aberrant epithelial differentiation and regeneration contribute to colon pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Myeloid translocation gene 16 (MTG16, also known as CBFA2T3) is a transcriptional corepressor expressed in the colonic epithelium. MTG16 deficiency in mice exacerbates colitis and increases tumor burden in CAC, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified MTG16 as a central mediator of epithelial differentiation, promoting goblet and restraining enteroendocrine cell development in homeostasis and enabling regeneration following dextran sulfate sodium-induced (DSS-induced) colitis. Transcriptomic analyses implicated increased Ephrussi box-binding transcription factor (E protein) activity in MTG16-deficient colon crypts. Using a mouse model with a point mutation that attenuates MTG16:E protein interactions (Mtg16P209T), we showed that MTG16 exerts control over colonic epithelial differentiation and regeneration by repressing E protein-mediated transcription. Mimicking murine colitis, MTG16 expression was increased in biopsies from patients with active IBD compared with unaffected controls. Finally, uncoupling MTG16:E protein interactions partially phenocopied the enhanced tumorigenicity of Mtg16-/- colon in the azoxymethane/DSS-induced model of CAC, indicating that MTG16 protects from tumorigenesis through additional mechanisms. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MTG16, via its repression of E protein targets, is a key regulator of cell fate decisions during colon homeostasis, colitis, and cancer.",

        "Title": "Optimising the treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis (OPTIMA trial): a protocol for a multicentre, randomised, double-blinded placebo-controlled study.",
        "Abstract": "Emerging evidence has shown that an antibiotic first strategy is a viable treatment option for uncomplicated acute appendicitis (AA). Although there has recently been an interest and increase in the use of antibiotics as the primary strategy for treating uncomplicated AA, there is no consensus regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen. In particular, the long-term outcomes of different antibiotic regimens, such as the recurrence rate, still lack evidence. Given that the flora of the appendix is mainly anaerobic bacteria, we hypothesised that antianaerobe regimens could decrease the recurrence rate compared with those that did not include antianaerobic antibiotics. The OPTIMA(Optimising the treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis) trial is a multicentre, double-blinded placebo-controlled superiority randomised study aimed to evaluate the role of antianaerobic antibiotics in the resolution of uncomplicated AA. Patients (18-65 years) with uncomplicated AA (without gangrenous, perforated appendicitis, appendiceal abscess, or appendiceal fecaliths) are eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoint of this study is the success rate of the treatment, defined as the resolution of AA resulting in discharge from the hospital without surgical intervention and recurrent symptoms within one year. Secondary endpoints include mortality, postintervention complications, recurrent symptoms up to one year after treatment, hospital stay, sick leave, treatment cost, pain symptom scores and quality of life. Data are reported as the number of cases (%), median (range) and relative risk, which will be analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test or χ<sup>2</sup> test, as appropriate. <i>P</i>-value<0.05 will be considered significant. The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinling Hospital on 13 November 2018 (2018NZKY-027-01). The trial findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals. ChiCTR1800018896.",

Therefore, it is important to determine whether the cause of the cholestasis is intrahepatic, hepatic or extrahepatic. Case description This article describes a 61-year-old male who was referred to our Gastroenterology Department. Transabdominal ultrasound showed dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts and the common bile duct, probably caused by a sludge ball. He underwent an ERCP during which a mass instead of a gallstone was extracted. Histological examination showed (a metastasis of) a melanoma. The patient was referred to the dermatologist who found a melanoma on the chest. The final diagnosis was metastasis of melanoma to the common bile duct. Jaundice can be caused by a variety of disorders. A systematic approach based on signs and symptoms is essential to recognize uncommon diagnoses without unnecessary delay.",

        "Abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder resulting from glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Patients benefit from early treatment as complications can arise from delayed diagnosis. To measure GD awareness among Japanese haematologists and gastroenterologists, who are the specialists most likely to encounter patients with symptoms recognised in the Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus (GED-C), such as hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, we aimed to determine key signs from the GED-C associated with early diagnosis. A quantitative web survey assessed Japanese haematologists and gastroenterologists for their (i) basic awareness of GD, (ii) explicit awareness of GD signs, (iii) explicit awareness of GD treatments and (iv) accuracy in suspecting GD in model patients. Survey results from 160 haematologists and 166 gastroenterologists indicated that more than 50% of haematologists were aware of GD symptoms, diagnostic criteria and/or treatments, and 38% of them had experienced or suspected GD. The majority of gastroenterologists were unaware of GD or knew the disease only by name, with 20% experiencing or suspecting GD in practice. Almost 70% of haematologists knew of enzyme replacement therapy, while 47% of gastroenterologists were not aware of any treatments for GD. Of the GED-C items, an awareness of bone-associated signs was correlated with accurate GD diagnosis in model patients and this awareness was greater among haematologists than gastroenterologists. The present study showed that haematologists had greater awareness of GD than gastroenterologists, and that bone pain may be a key sign of GD to enhance early diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloidosis encompasses several diseases associated with deposition of low-molecular-weight proteins in an abnormal configuration. In light-chain amyloidosis (AL), monoclonal free lambda (<i>λ</i>) or kappa (<i>κ</i>) light chains are the amyloid proteins involved and can deposit in almost any organ. Symptoms vary depending on presence and extent of organ involvement, and thus, clinical presentation varies. Diagnosis requires biopsy of the affected tissue, and sometimes, fat pad or bone marrow biopsy is completed initially. Prognosis of AL amyloidosis depends on the presence of cardiac involvement. Treatment of AL amyloidosis involves systemic chemotherapy and evaluation for autologous stem cell transplant. Herein, we present a case report of an asymptomatic middle-aged female who was diagnosed with AL amyloidosis during an average-risk screening colonoscopy, which is an unusual setting. We discuss the workup involved, clinical presentation, and gastroenterology-related organ involvement.",

We present a case report of an 11-year-old boy admitted to the ER in the spring of 2020 (the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic in Poland) due to nausea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes accompanied by severe ketoacidosis (pH 6.9, blood glucose 632mg/dl, ketone bodies in urine - 150mg/dl) was made. The hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and water-electrolyte disturbances were treated in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. On day 4, the boy developed fulminant septic shock with high aminotransferases (AST 9026 U/l, ALT 3559 U/l). CT scan revealed hepatic enlargement and steatosis. Acute viral hepatitis was suspected. The levels of anti-CMV IgM and IgG antibodies were slightly elevated. At autopsy, the liver was enlarged, with petechial bleedings on the surface. The liver parenchyma was congested, with signs of steatosis. Microscopically, there was extensive centrilobular necrosis, acute passive sinusoidal congestion, and steatosis of hepatocytes. There were no signs of CMV infection. Based on the entire clinicopathological picture, the patient was diagnosed with hypoxic hepatitis, complicated by septic shock and multiple organ failure.",

        "Abstract": "Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a common disease with a significant impact on physical health and quality of life (QoL). Outcomes and management vary widely, with no agreed UK national guideline. This paper aims to describe an up-to-date description of demographics, clinical spectrum and outcomes for paediatric and adult patients with EoE from the North East of England between 2016 and 2019. Patients from two large University Hospitals and the specialist paediatric hospital for the North East of England with histologically or clinically confirmed EoE were included in this analysis. Data were collected retrospectively via electronic patient records. Remission was defined as either the resolution of symptoms or improvement on histology. Data were collected on 74 paediatric and 59 adult patients. Dysphagia was the most common presenting symptom in both groups, accounting for 51%-84% of all presentations. Proton pump inhibitors and dietary manipulation were the most common therapies associated with remission in children (95% of those achieving remission), whereas the use of swallowed topical steroids was more prevalent in the treatment of adults (55% achieving remission). EoE is a complex disease and poses significant challenges. Outcomes vary widely and need to be tailored to individual patient groups. Dietary manipulation plays a major role in treatment for EoE, but this is likely to be challenging for patients, especially children. Future work should continue to assess the outcomes in EoE, including on QoL and potential novel targeted therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Big data is defined as being large, varied or frequently updated, and usually generated from real-world interaction. With the unprecedented availability of big data, comes an obligation to maximise its potential for healthcare improvements in treatment effectiveness, disease prevention and healthcare delivery. We review the opportunities and challenges that big data brings to gastroenterology. We review its sources for healthcare improvement in gastroenterology, including electronic medical records, patient registries and patient-generated data. Big data can complement traditional research methods in hypothesis generation, supporting studies and disseminating findings; and in some cases holds distinct advantages where traditional trials are unfeasible. There is great potential power in patient-level linkage of datasets to help quantify inequalities, identify best practice and improve patient outcomes. We exemplify this with the UK colorectal cancer repository and the potential of linkage using the National Endoscopy Database, the inflammatory bowel disease registry and the National Health Service bowel cancer screening programme. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly being used to improve diagnostics in gastroenterology, with image analysis entering clinical practice, and the potential of machine learning to improve outcome prediction and diagnostics in other clinical areas. Big data brings issues with large sample sizes, real-world biases, data curation, keeping clinical context at analysis and General Data Protection Regulation compliance. There is a tension between our obligation to use data for the common good and protecting individual patient's data. We emphasise the importance of engaging with our patients to enable them to understand their data usage as fully as they wish.",

        "Abstract": "Training and quality assurance in oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is important to ensure competent practice. A national evidence-based review was undertaken to update and develop standards and recommendations for OGD training and certification. Under the oversight of the Joint Advisory Group (JAG), a modified Delphi process was conducted with stakeholder representation from British Society of Gastroenterology, Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons, trainees and trainers. Recommendations on OGD training and certification were formulated following literature review and appraised using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. These were subjected to electronic voting to achieve consensus. Accepted statements were incorporated into the updated certification pathway. In total, 32 recommendation statements were generated for the following domains: definition of competence (4 statements), acquisition of competence (12 statements), assessment of competence (10 statements) and post-certification support (6 statements). The consensus process led to following certification criteria: (1) performing ≥250 hands-on procedures; (2) attending a JAG-accredited basic skills course; (3) attainment of relevant minimal performance standards defined by British Society of Gastroenterology/Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, (4) achieving physically unassisted D2 intubation and J-manoeuvre in ≥95% of recent procedures, (5) satisfactory performance in formative and summative direct observation of procedural skills assessments. The JAG standards for diagnostic OGD have been updated following evidence-based consensus. These standards are intended to support training, improve competency assessment to uphold standards of practice and provide support to the newly-independent practitioner.",

        "Abstract": "Specialized biopsychosocial care concepts are necessary to overcome the dualism between physical and psychosocial treatment in acute care hospitals. For patients with complex and chronic comorbid physical and mental health problems, neither standardized psychiatric/psychosomatic nor somatic care units alone are appropriate to their needs. The \" <i><b>N</b></i> uremberg <i><b>I</b></i> ntegrated <i><b>P</b></i> sychosomatic <i><b>A</b></i> cute Unit\" (NIPA) has been developed to integrate treatment of both, psychosocial and physical impairments, in an acute somatic care setting. NIPA has been established in inpatient internal medical wards for respiratory medicine, oncology and gastroenterology. One to two patients per ward are regularly enrolled in the NIPA treatment while remaining in the same inpatient bed after completion of the somatic care. In a naturalistic study design, we evaluated treatment effects by assessment of symptom load at admission and at discharge using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). Furthermore, we assessed the severity of morbidity using diagnosis data during treatment. At discharge, we measured satisfaction with treatment through the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ZUF-8). Data from 41 NIPA patients were analyzed (18-87 years, 76% female). Seventy-eight percent suffered from at least moderate depression and 49% from anxiety disorders. Other diagnoses were somatoform pain disorder, somatoform autonomic dysfunction, eating disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Hypertension, chronic lung diseases and musculoskeletal disorders as well as chronic oncological and cardiac diseases were the most common somatic comorbidities. Treatment resulted in a significant reduction of depressive mood (admission: <i>M</i> = 10.9, <i>SD</i> = 6.1, discharge: <i>M</i> = 7.6, <i>SD</i> = 5.3, <i>d</i> = 0.58, <i>p</i> = <i>0.001</i>), anxiety (admission: <i>M</i> = 10.6, <i>SD</i> = 4.9, discharge: <i>M</i> = 7.3, <i>SD</i> = 4.1, <i>d</i> = 0.65, <i>p</i>< <i>0.001</i>) and stress (admission: <i>M</i> = 6.0, <i>SD</i> = 3.6, discharge: <i>M</i> = 4.1, <i>SD</i> = 2.5, <i>d</i> = 0.70, <i>p</i>< <i>0.001</i>). Somatic symptom burden was reduced by NIPA treatment (admission: <i>M</i> = 10.9, <i>SD</i> = 5.8, discharge: <i>M</i> = 9.6, <i>SD</i> = 5.5, <i>d</i> = 0.30), albeit not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = <i>0.073</i>) ZUF-8 revealed that 89% reported large or full satisfaction and 11% partial dissatisfaction with treatment. NIPA acute care is bridging the gap for patients in need of psychosocial treatment with complex somatic comorbidity. Further long-term evaluation will show whether psychosocial NIPA care is able to reduce the course of physical illness and hospital costs by preventing hospitalization and short-term inpatient re-admissions.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a standardized endoscopist acceptance scale for the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in gastrointestinal endoscopy. After investigating endoscopists who have previously used AI and consulting with AI experts, we developed a provisional scale to measure the acceptance of AI as used in gastrointestinal endoscopy that was then distributed to a sample of endoscopists who have used AI. After analyzing the feedback data collected on the provisional scale, we developed a new formal scale with four factors. Cronbach's alpha, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), content validity, and related validity were conducted to test the reliability and validity of the formal scale. We also constructed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in order to determine the scale's ability to distinguish higher acceptance and satisfaction. A total of 210 valid formal scale data points were collected. The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.904. All the factor loadings were >0.50, of which the highest factor loading was 0.86 and the lowest was 0.54 (AVE = 0.580, CR = 0.953). The correlation coefficient between the total score of the scale and the satisfaction score was 0.876, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.949 ± 0.031. Endoscopists with a score higher than 50 tend to be accepting and satisfied with AI. This study yielded a viable questionnaire to measure the acceptance among endoscopists of the implementation of AI in gastroenterology.",

The best-known disorders are irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Jawarish Shahi (JS) is used for gastrointestinal disorders in Unani Medicine (UM). The present review aims to evaluate the FD and IBS in Unani medicine and scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of JS and its herbal ingredients in the management of FD and IBS. Sources of data are from the classical literature of UM, Canon of medicine, Khazainul Advia, Indian Medicinal Plants-An Illustrated Dictionary. Databases, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, were explored for related studies. An updated review on the concept of FGIDs in Unani medicine, its pathophysiology, and management is presented. Comprehensive information on JS and its traditional and ethnopharmacological clinical attributes, standardization and toxicity study, biomedical studies of herbs in JS for their efficacies in FD and IBS are presented. The outcome of the work clearly indicates that disease conditions similar to FD and IBS and their successful treatment are described in Unani Medicine. JS has been used for disease conditions similar to FD and IBS by the physicians of the medieval period. The herbs in JS are widely researched for pharmacologically active substances and were reported for antioxidant, immunomodulatory, gastroprotective, antispasmodic, analgesic, antidiarrheal, antisecretory, laxative, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and antidepressant properties. Nevertheless, further explorations, particularly well-designed clinical trials are required for efficacy.",

        "Title": "Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group.",
        "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common, affecting approximately 25% of the general population. The evidence base for the investigation and management of NAFLD is large and growing, but there is currently little practical guidance to support development of services and delivery of care. To address this, we produced a series of evidence-based quality standard recommendations for the management of NAFLD, with the aim of improving patient care. A multidisciplinary group of experts from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group produced the recommendations, which cover: management of people with, or at risk of, NAFLD before the gastroenterology or liver clinic; assessment and investigations in secondary care; and management in secondary care. The quality of evidence for each recommendation was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. An anonymous modified Delphi voting process was conducted individually by each member of the group to assess the level of agreement with each statement. Statements were included when agreement was 80% or greater. From the final list of statements, a smaller number of auditable key performance indicators were selected to allow services to benchmark their practice. It is hoped that services will review their practice against our recommendations and key performance indicators and institute service development where needed to improve the care of patients with NAFLD.",

        "Title": "The glucocorticoid toxicity index: Measuring change in glucocorticoid toxicity over time.",
        "Abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) have been the cornerstone of treating dozens of inflammatory conditions for more than seven decades. GC toxicity is ubiquitous in both clinical trials and clinical practice, and toxicities associated with GC use are central to the experience of most patients being treated for immune-mediated conditions. These conditions span the full range of medical specialties, including rheumatology, nephrology, gastroenterology, neurology, pulmonology, ophthalmology, and others. One of the goals of novel therapies for inflammatory disease must be to diminish the effects of GC toxicity in clinically important ways, thereby differentiating these new treatments from existing approaches. Despite the importance of glucocorticoids in the treatment of inflammatory disease for more than 70 years, no reliable means of calculating the degree to which GC toxicity has worsened or improved over the course of treatment has been available. The Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI), developed by an international group of subspecialty physician experts as a clinician-facing clinical trials outcome measure, is a standardized, validated measure of the phenomenon known as GC toxicity. The purpose of the instrument is to measure change in GC toxicity between two points in time: for example, between the baseline visit and the time of the primary efficacy outcome assessment. The instrument is designed to quantify both worsening and improvement in GC toxicity. The GTI has been validated in both real-world experiences and clinical trials, including a phase 3, label-enabling trial in ANCA associated vasculitis. This article reviews the history and rationale for the development of the GTI, describes key data from validation studies, considers the minimum clinically important difference, and provides instructions for use of the instrument.",

        "Abstract": "In patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS), severe malabsorption may cause a need for parenteral support and, by definition, these patients suffer from SBS intestinal failure. Absorption of oral medications is likely diminished in patients with SBS intestinal failure and higher than normal doses may be required to achieve sufficient pharmacologic effect. We investigated the prescription patterns and oral dosages in a well-defined population of patients with non-malignant SBS intestinal failure. This was a cross-sectional analysis based on a cohort of adult patients with SBS intestinal failure treated with home parenteral support and registered in 2016 at the Department of Gastroenterology at the Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet. The patients' clinical data and prescription patterns were extracted from electronic medical and medications records. The patients in our cohort (n = 74) were primarily females (58%), the median age was 63 years (interquartile range (IQR): 52-72 years) and the median BMI was 22 kg/m2 (IQR: 19-26 kg/m2). Each patient was treated with a median of eight drugs (range: 1-20). Most (75%) of the medications were administered orally. Only codeine, levothyroxine and loperamide were prescribed in higher dosages than recommended in their product labelling. All medication-treated patients were prescribed between one and four different analgesics. In our single-centre cohort of patients with SBS intestinal failure, orally administered medications were generally prescribed in recommended dosages. none Trial registration.

        "Title": "Virtual Specialist Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multimethod Patient Experience Study.",
        "Abstract": "Transitioning nonemergency, ambulatory medical care to virtual visits in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic has been a massive shift in philosophy and practice that naturally came with a steep learning curve for patients, physicians, and clinic administrators. We undertook a multimethod study to understand the key factors associated with successful and less successful experiences of virtual specialist care, particularly as they relate to the patient experience of care. This study was designed as a multimethod patient experience study using survey methods, descriptive qualitative interview methodology, and administrative virtual care data collected by the hospital decision support team. Six specialty departments participated in the study (endoscopy, orthopedics, neurology, hematology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology). All patients who could speak and read English and attended a virtual specialist appointment in a participating clinic at St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) between October 1, 2020, and January 30, 2021, were eligible to participate. During the study period, 51,702 virtual specialist visits were conducted in the departments that participated in the study. Of those, 96% were conducted by telephone and 4% by video. In both the survey and interview data, there was an overall consensus that virtual care is a satisfying alternative to in-person care, with benefits such as reduced travel, cost, time, and SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and increased convenience. Our analysis further revealed that the specific reason for the visit and the nature and status of the medical condition are important considerations in terms of guidance on where virtual care is most effective. Technology issues were not reported as a major challenge in our data, given that the majority of \"virtual\" visits reported by our participants were conducted by telephone, which is an important distinction. Despite the positive value of virtual care discussed by the majority of interview participants, 50% of the survey respondents still indicated they would prefer to see their physician in person. Patient experience data collected in this study indicate a high level of satisfaction with virtual specialty care, but also signal that there are nuances to be considered to ensure it is an appropriate and sustainable part of the standard of care.",

        "Abstract": "During the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, gastroenterology guidelines recommended the suspension or reduction of non-urgent endoscopy. We aimed to assess the appropriateness and safety of endoscopic activity during the pandemic first wave lockdown using European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) recommendations. We identified scheduled patients from the onset of the lockdown in Spain since March 16, 2020) to April 14, 2020. Daily hospital COVID-19-related burden was also registered. A similar cohort from a period immediately before the lockdown was studied (pre-lockdown cohort) to compare appropriateness. 454 endoscopy procedures were performed during the studied period, comprising a 49.7% reduction compared to the pre-lockdown cohort (n = 913). There was a significant increase in ESGE high-priority indications (62.1% vs. 45.6%, p<0.001) associated with an increase in relevant endoscopic findings (p = 0.006), advanced neoplasia/cancer (p = 0.004) and cancer detection rate (p = 0.010). There were no differences in the rate of admissions or infection among scheduled patients in the lockdown cohort. None of the staff members tested positive for COVID-19 in the 7 days after the adoption of protective measures. A prioritized endoscopic activity is not associated with higher contagion after adopting protective measures. In addition, a triage of procedures that follow the ESGE criteria increases the rate of relevant endoscopic findings. These considerations may reduce the impact of the delays of diagnosis after the pandemic.",

The current study therefore aimed to explore the health-seeking behaviors and challenges faced by patients for the management of gastrointestinal diseases. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient department of Gastroenterology, Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi from March 2020 to July 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown phase to explore patient experiences. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire. All patients of either gender were included after informed consent. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using SPSS 21.0. A total of 184 patients were included who visited the hospital to seek medical services during the COVID-19 lockdown phase. The mean age of the population was 42.7 years (±16.13). Of these, n=94 (51.1%) were males All patients had gastrointestinal issues with different comorbid conditions. One forty-seven n=147 (79.9%) presented with active complaints whereas, n=37 (20.1%) patients visited the hospital for their follow-up checkup. Out of 184 patients, n=33 (17.9%) patients reported of having fear of visiting hospital due to COVID-19 outbreak. A statistically significant difference <i>p<</i>0.001 was noted between the history of comorbidities and patient delaying a visit to the healthcare due to the fear of COVID-19. Additionally, 61 (73.5%) patients with co-morbidity faced difficulty in finding public transport (p=0.01). Nevertheless, n=171 (93.0%) patients expressed satisfaction with the services provided by the hospital during the lockdown phase. Patients with gastrointestinal conditions were largely affected by lockdown largely due to fear of contacting COVID-19 disease and inaccessibility to the public transportation. Widely available telemedicine service might overcome these shortcomings and ensure continuity of quality care.",

        "Abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented disruptions to several aspects of gastroenterology healthcare services worldwide. In particular, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent a sensitive population that must retain access to healthcare services to avoid potential disease exacerbation under the continuous threat of viral infection. Emerging evidence also highlights the severe impact on these patients' mental well-being, leading to a constant cycle of stress/depression and disease activity relapse. In an effort to circumvent these healthcare challenges in a newly-shaped environment, physicians implemented telemedicine consultative care programs as a novel alternative follow-up method highly favored by the patients. The situation is still far from perfect, since a large proportion of patients are lost to follow up and/or lose adherence to their medication, especially when the exact timeframe or optimal strategy for the post-COVID era remains to be defined. Cancelation of elective endoscopic procedures has led to a significant decline of new IBD diagnoses. This review summarizes the data on the global impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients' healthcare and their psychosocial status.",

The aim of this survey, which was part of a global survey on training in pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (PGHN) across Europe, was to assess the PH and liver transplantation (LT) infrastructure, staff and training programs in PGHN training centers. Standardized questionnaires were collected from training centers via the presidents/representatives of the National Societies Network of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) from June 2016 to December 2019. A total of 100 PGHN training centers participated in the survey (14/100 were national referral centers in PH and/or LT). Dedicated PH clinics were available in 75%, but LT clinics in only 11%. Dedicated beds for PGHN inpatients were available in 47/95 (49%) centers. Full-time or part-time specialists for PH care were available in 31/45 (69%) and 11/36 (31%) centers, respectively. Liver biopsies (LB) were performed in 93% of centers by: a PGHN specialist (35%); an interventional radiologist (26%); a pediatric surgeon (4%); or a combination of them (35%). Dividing the annual number of LBs in the centers performing LBs by the number of trainees gave a median (range) of 10 (1-125) per trainee. Transient elastography was available in 60/92 (65%) of centers. The survey highlighted the differences and shortcomings in PH training across Europe. ESPGHAN should take initiatives together with National Societies to ensure the acquisition of PH knowledge and skills according to the ESPGHAN curriculum.An infographic is available for this article at: http://www.annalsgastro.gr/files/journals/1/earlyview/2022/Infographic-Hepatology-training-paper.pdf.",

At a community level, there is scarce mechanistic evidence on the effects of gut microbial alterations on host mucosal barrier responses. We used a computational microbe-host interaction prediction framework based on network diffusion and systems biology to integrate publicly available paired gut microbial and intestinal gene expression datasets. The ileal signaling network potentially modulated by the microbiota was enriched with immune-related pathways such as those associated with IL-4, IL-2, IL-13, NFkB, and toll-like receptors. We identified bacterial proteins eliciting post-translational modifications on host receptors, resulting in the de-repression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via critical hub proteins such as NFkB. The signaling networks were over-represented with CD associated genes and CD drug targets. Using datasets generated from our validation cohorts, we confirmed some of the results.",

        "Abstract": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are placed by gastroenterologists (GI) and surgeons throughout the country. At Rhode Island Hospital, before July of 2017, all PEGs were placed by GI. In July of 2017, in response to a growing need for PEGs, acute care surgeons (ACS) also began performing PEGs at the bedside in ICUs. The purpose of this study was to review and compare outcomes of PEG tubes placed by ACS and GI. Retrospective chart review of patients who received a PEG placed by ACS or GI at the bedside in any ICU from December 2016 to September 2019. Charts were reviewed for the following outcomes: Success rates of placing PEG, duration of procedure, major complications, and death. Secondary outcomes included discharge disposition, and rates of comfort measures only after PEG. In 2017, 75% of PEGs were placed by GI and 25% surgery. In 2018, 47% were placed by GI and 53% by surgery. In 2019, 33% were placed by GI and 67% by surgery. There was no significant difference in success rates between surgery (146/156 93.6%) and GI (173/185 93.5%) (p 0.97). On average, GI performed the procedure faster than surgery [Median 10 (7-16) min vs 16 (13-21) mins, respectively, p < 0.001]. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the PEG outcomes or complications investigated. Bedside PEG tube placement appears to be a safe procedure in the ICU population. GI and Surgery had nearly identical success rates in placing PEGs. GI performed the procedure faster than surgery. There were no significant differences in the reviewed patient outcomes or complications between PEGs placed by ACS or GI. Of note, when a complication occurred, ACS PEG patients typically were managed in the OR while GI tended to re-PEG patients highlighting a potential difference in management that should be further investigated.",

        "Title": "Schwartz Rounds for Staff in an Australian Tertiary Hospital: Protocol for a Pilot Uncontrolled Trial.",
        "Abstract": "Schwartz Rounds are a unique, organization-wide interdisciplinary intervention aimed at enhancing staff well-being, compassionate care, teamwork, and organizational culture in health care settings. They provide a safe space wherein both clinical and nonclinical health staff can connect and share their experiences about the social and emotional aspects of health care. Although Schwartz Rounds have been assessed and widely implemented in the United States and United Kingdom, they are yet to be formally evaluated in Australian health care settings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and impact of Schwartz Rounds on staff well-being, compassionate care, and organizational culture, in a tertiary metropolitan hospital in Brisbane, Australia. This mixed methods repeated measures pilot study will recruit 24 participants in 2 groups from 2 departments, the intensive care unit and the gastroenterology department. Participants from each group will take part in 3 unit-based Schwartz Rounds. Primary outcomes will include the study and intervention feasibility measures, while secondary outcomes will include scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey, the Schwartz Centre Compassionate Care Scale, and the Culture of Care Barometer. Primary and secondary outcomes will be collected at baseline, after the Rounds, and 3-month follow-up. Two focus groups will be held approximately 2 months after completion of the Schwartz Rounds. Descriptive statistics, paired t tests, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance will be used to compare quantitative data across time points and groups. Qualitative data from focus groups and free-text survey questions will be analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. The study was approved by the Mater Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (reference number: HREC/MML/71868) and recruitment commenced in July 2021; study completion is anticipated by May 2022. The study will contribute to the assessment of feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the Schwartz Rounds in a tertiary Australian hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "Abstract": "There is a wide differential diagnosis within polyposis syndromes. Our case represents an interesting and diagnostically challenging diagnosis involving a 41-year-old male who presented with an incidental gastric mass on imaging and a colonic mass seen on colonoscopy. Following multiple endoscopic evaluations, histological analysis, and genetic testing, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS)/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) despite the initial suspicion for Ménétrier's disease. His disease course was complicated by an acute upper extremity thrombus and diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma. This case highlights the importance of a thorough evaluation when polyposis syndromes are suspected. Prompt and accurate diagnosis can aid in the treatment, surveillance, and prevention of colorectal carcinoma.",

        "Title": "Ectopic variceal bleeding from chronic superior mesenteric vein thrombosis after hemorrhagic pancreatitis.",
        "Abstract": "Varices are a common cause of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. When ectopic, there is often a delay in diagnosis as it is difficult to localize these varices. Ectopic small bowel varices usually arise from portal hypertension, which commonly develops in the setting of cirrhosis. This case presents a much rarer cause of bleeding ectopic varices with portal hypertension secondary to chronic superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis that developed after an episode of hemorrhagic pancreatitis. An 81-year-old man with a past medical history of a recent GI bleeds secondary to an arteriovenous malformation presented to the hospital with continued melena after a recent admission at another hospital for the same symptom. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy showed no evidence of active bleeding. Subsequently computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed bleeding from collaterals in the third part of the duodenum, consistent with ectopic varices. The CTA also showed SMV thrombosis. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided transhepatic venogram with coiling and sclerosant embolization of SMV varices and distal SMV balloon angioplasty. Capsule endoscopy after showed no evidence of further bleeding. The patient was discharged 72 h after the intervention with stabilized hemoglobin and resolved melena. Ectopic varices should be on the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with a GI bleed that remains nonlocalized after endoscopy and colonoscopy. EGD or colonoscopy is the first-line intervention for the treatment of bleeding ectopic varices. If unreachable by these means, percutaneous coil embolization is an alternative way to stabilize the patient. As no general management guidelines exist, treatment of bleeding ectopic varices should continue to be case-dependent and involve a multidisciplinary team.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital chloride losing diarrhoea (CCLD) is a rare disease caused by mutations in an intestinal chloride/bicarbonate ion exchange channel. Few reports describe CCLD in adults and none has described the impact of a parasitic infection on CCLD. Severe diarrhoea may result in hypokalaemia with QT interval prolongation. Treatment with antiemetics may further increase the QT interval. To raise awareness of this preventable complication, we describe the course of a woman in her 20s with CCLD who developed COVID-19 and a <i>Blastocystis hominis</i> infestation. Treatment with antiemetics and hypokalaemia resulted in prolongation of the QT interval to 640 ms. While, the QT interval normalised with discontinuation of antiemetics and electrolyte replacement, patients with CCLD must take precautions to prevent gastrointestinal infections. Regardless, whenever patients with CCLD present to hospital, the authors recommend monitoring the QT interval and avoiding medications that predispose to torsade de pointes.",

        "Abstract": "Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes require timely endoscopic surveillance. This study evaluated the approach of Italian gastroenterologists to the management of such patients. It then assessed the impact of SARS-CoV-2. All members affiliated with the leading Italian gastroenterology societies (AIGO, SIED, and SIGE) received an online questionnaire. One hundred and twenty-one clinicians from 96 centers answered, not necessarily experts in the field (mean age 50.26 ± 11.22 years). Many collected family history for genetic risk assessment (74.4%), but only 14.0% used an online predictive software. 65.6% discussed cases in multidisciplinary units. Genetic analysis was available to most centers, but only a few hospitals offered dedicated endoscopy (19.0%), outpatient clinics (33.9%), or surgeries (23.1%). Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the number of clinicians with a high volume of patients decreased (from 38.8% to 28.1%). Almost half of the responders (45.5%) reported a delay in the surveillance (median: 4-12 months). Ultimately, 30.6% detected one interval colorectal cancer in at least one of their patients. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic directly affected the surveillance of hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes in Italy. Endoscopic surveillance should resume in all centers to avoid the possible long-term consequences of its interruption, especially for inherited colorectal cancer syndromes.",

        "Abstract": "Gut decontamination could have some benefits in preventing infectious complications in acute pancreatitis (AP). To investigate whether the administration of rifaximin could have an impact on the outcomes of AP. We conducted a retrospective study on 373 patients with a median age of 50 years that were admitted to our Department of Gastroenterology in the years 2001-2016 with a diagnosis of AP. Patients were subclassified according to the revised Atlanta criteria: mild acute pancreatitis (MAP), moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) and severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Thereafter, all the patients were divided into 2 groups: in the 1st group (R0) with MSAP and SAP, patients did not receive rifaximin, and in the 2nd group (R1), in the cases of MSAP and SAP, rifaximin was administered to patients at a dose of 3 × 400 mg (for at least 5 days and up to 7 days). There was no other difference in the treatment between the groups. The median duration of hospital stay, the number of infectious complications and the mortality rate were recorded for both groups. A significant difference was observed between median durations of hospitalization between the groups with (R1) and without (R0) rifaximin treatment (14 days compared to 24 days, p = 0.001) and in the number of patients infected with pancreatic necrosis (7 compared to 1, p = 0.0487). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the R1 and R0 group in terms of mortality rate. The results indicate that rifaximin seems to be a promising novel therapeutic option in MSAP and SAP.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between the gut microbiome and various organ systems has gained interest throughout the scientific community in recent times. The understanding of these complex relationships has greatly improved with clinical benefits now being seen. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a form of extracorporeal circulation that provides circulatory and respiratory support during cardiac surgery. This physiological support facilitates a still and bloodless field facilitating operations on the heart to be performed. Through various mechanisms CPB results in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This response can vary from mild hypotension to multiple organ failure. It remains difficult to predict the degree to which a patient will experience SIRS post-operatively. The relationship between the composition of the gut microbiome and inflammatory processes associated with disease has been seen across several fields including gastroenterology, neurology, psychiatry and cardiology. To date, minimal research has been undertaken to examine the impact the gut microbiome has on outcomes following cardiac surgery. This review paper explores the pathophysiology behind the SIRS response associated with CPB for cardiac surgery and the hypothesis that a correlation exists between a patients gut microbiome composition and the degree of inflammatory response experienced following cardiac surgery.",

The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of ARFID in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and assess provider recognition of an eating disorder in these patients. One hundred patients with IBD seen at the Mayo Clinic subspecialty IBD practice in Jacksonville, Florida were screened for ARFID. The diagnosis of ARFID was established using the Nine-Item Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Screen (NIAS) questionnaire. Providers also were asked their opinion of each participating patient's disease severity and whether they believed that the patient had an eating disorder. Of the 98 patients who completed the NIAS questionnaire, 10.2% scored above the clinical cutoff for ARFID. Clinician sensitivity in identifying an eating disorder was 0% and specificity was 96.5%. This pilot study suggests that patients with IBD are at risk for ARFID. Provider recognition of patients at risk for an eating disorder was low. Efforts to educate gastroenterology clinicians to identify and screen at-risk patients for ARFID and other eating disorders are needed.",

        "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic necessitated a shift to telemedicine for many clinics. This study aimed to better understand patient perception regarding telemedicine visits in a pediatric subspecialty clinic and to describe differences in management provided virtually versus in-person. This survey study and chart review was conducted at the Doernbecher Children's Hospital gastroenterology outreach clinics from May to June, 2020. The main hospital is located in Portland, Oregon, with the outreach clinics located in Salem, Eugene, and Medford, Oregon. Families were surveyed within 2 weeks of their visit, with a 6-month follow up survey. There were 111 respondents to the initial survey (34% response rate). The majority of patients had initial positive impressions of telemedicine, with 75% feeling that the quality of telemedicine visits were as good as or better than in-person visits. At 6 months, there were 80 respondents (34% response rate), and this positive impression persisted with 72% of families reporting no negatives from their telemedicine experience. New patients seen via telemedicine were prescribed medications more frequently than those seen in-person (73% versus 45%, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Patients and families felt the benefits of telemedicine visits outweighed the limitations both initially and at 6-month follow up. Telemedicine offers an effective alternative for pediatric subspecialty care especially for select conditions and follow up visits. However, the more frequent prescriptions could reflect the adaptation of clinical practice with the telemedicine platform, and further studies are needed.",

Phytobezoars are the most common type of bezoars and are composed of indigestible cellulose and lignin from fruits and vegetables. We present a unique case of esophageal phytobezoar, which was seen in a patient with long-standing achalasia. The patient presented to the gastroenterology clinic complaining of decreased appetite as she had worsening dysphagia, weight loss, vomiting on eating food. An endoscopy revealed a large phytobezoar that was extending along the whole length of the esophagus. There was stenosis at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The phytobezoar was dissolved with carbonated soda lavage and the remainder of the phytobezoar was fragmented with water irrigation and rescue net via the endoscope and fragments were retrieved. Botulinum was injected at the GE junction in all four quadrants which resulted in a relaxation of the stenosis. Untreated long-standing esophageal phytobezoars can lead to life-threatening complications like perforation. Endoscopic modalities with carbonated soda lavage is an efficacious mode of treatment. Surgical interventions are recommended in case of endoscopic modality failure.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) derived from bone marrow can promote liver regeneration and improve the liver function of patients, but there are few studies on its effect on the long-term outcomes in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Based on previous work, this study observed the clinical outcomes of PBSC treatment in patients with decompensated cirrhosis for 10 years, in order to provide more data support for the safety and efficacy of stem cells in clinical applications. <b>Methods:</b> Data of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis who completed PBSC treatment in the Department of Gastroenterology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University from August 2005 to February 2012 were included. The follow-up endpoint was death or liver transplantation, and patients who did not reach the follow-up endpoint were followed-up for at least 10 years. The patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis who met the conditions for PBSC treatment but did not receive PBSC treatment in our hospital during the same period were used as controls. <b>Results:</b> A total of 287 cases with decompensated liver cirrhosis had completed PBSC treatment, and 90 cases were lost to follow-up within 10 years after surgery. A total of 151 cases with complete survival follow-up data were included in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline information such as gender, age, etiological composition and liver function score between the two groups. The 10-year survival rate was higher in PBSC than control group (37.56% vs. 26.49%, <i>P</i><0.05). Cholinesterase, albumin, international normalized ratio, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease score, and other indicators were gradually recovered within 3 months to 1 year after PBSC treatment, and stabilized at a more desirable level in the long-term after follow-up for up to 10 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of liver cancer between the two groups (25.22% vs.31.85%, <i>P</i>=0.267). The age of onset of hepatocellular carcinoma was later in PBSC than control group [(56.66±7.21) years vs. (52.69±8.42) years, <i>P</i><0.05]. <b>Conclusions:</b> This long-term observational follow-up study of more than ten years confirms that PBSC treatment can bring long-term benefits to patients with decompensated cirrhosis, with good long-term safety, thus providing more data support on the safety and efficacy of stem cells for clinical applications.",

        "Title": "Review article: rethinking the \"ladder\" approach to reflux-like symptom management in the era of PPI \"resistance\" - a multidisciplinary perspective.",
        "Abstract": "Despite widespread adoption of potent acid suppression treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for reflux-like symptoms, persistent symptoms are commonly reported in primary care and community studies. This multidisciplinary review critically evaluates how the management of reflux-like symptoms could better reflect their multifactorial pathophysiology. A panel of experts (from general practice, gastroenterology and gastropsychology) attended a series of workshops to review current management and propose a framework for the provision of more individualised care. It was agreed that the perceptual (as well as the physiological) causes of reflux-like symptoms should be considered at the start of management, not as a last resort when all else has failed. A short course of PPI is a pragmatic approach to address reflux-like symptoms, but equally important is counselling about the gut-brain axis and provision of symptom-specific behavioural interventions for those who show signs of somatisation, hypervigilance or co-existing disorders of gut-brain interaction. Other low-harm interventions such as lifestyle and dietary advice, should also be better integrated into care at an early stage. Multidisciplinary care management programmes (including dietary, weight loss, exercise and behavioural intervention) should be developed to promote greater self-management and take advantage of the general shift toward the use of remotely accessed health care resources. Management of reflux-like symptoms should be adapted to reflect the advances in knowledge about the multifactorial aetiology of these symptoms, addressing both acid-related and behavioural components early in management. The time has come to treat the patient, not the \"disease\".",

        "Abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) are a safe and highly effective treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, the uptake of DAA treatment remains a challenge. This study aims to examine the reasons for DAA refusal among HCV patients covered by the Taiwan National Health Insurance system. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective observational study covered the period from January 2009 to December 2019 and was conducted at a single hepatitis treatment center in Taiwan. This study involved chart reviews and phone-based surveys to confirm treatment status and refusal causes. To confirm treatment status, subjects with HCV without treatment records were phone-contacted to confirm treatment status. Patients who did not receive treatment were invited back for treatment. If the patient refused, the reason for refusal was discussed. <i>Results</i>: A total of 3566 patients were confirmed with DAA treatment; 418 patients (179 patients who were lost to contact or refused the survey and 239 patients who completed the survey of DAA refusal) were included in the no-DAA-therapy group. Factors associated with receiving DAAs were hemoglobin levels, hepatitis B virus co-infection, and regular gastroenterology visits. Meanwhile, male sex, platelet levels, and primary care physician visits were associated with DAA refusal. The leading causes of treatment refusal were multiple comorbidities, low health literacy, restricted access to hospitals, nursing home residence, and old age. The rate of DAA refusal remains high (10%). <i>Conclusions</i>: The reasons for treatment refusal are multifactorial, and addressing them requires complex interventions.",

        "Title": "Hypertriglyceridaemia-Induced Acute Pancreatitis: A Different Disease Phenotype.",
        "Abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the most common gastrointestinal indication requiring hospitalisation. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) is the third most common aetiology of AP (HTGAP), with a complication rate and severity that are higher than those of other aetiologies (non-HTGAP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the supposedly higher complication rate of HTGAP compared to non-HTGAP. The secondary objectives were to find different biomarkers for predicting a severe form. This was a retrospective study that included patients admitted with AP in a tertiary department of gastroenterology and hepatology. The patients were divided into two groups: HTGAP and non-HTGAP. We searched for differences regarding age, gender, the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), the severity of the disease, the types of complications and predictive biomarkers for severity, hospital stay and mortality. A total of 262 patients were included, and 11% (30/262) of the patients had HTGAP. The mean ages were 44.4 ± 9.2 in the HTGAP group and 58.2 ± 17.1 in the non-HTGAP group, p < 0.0001. Male gender was predominant in both groups, at 76% (23/30) in the HTGAP group vs. 54% (126/232) in non-HTGAP, p = 0.02; 53% (16/30) presented with DM vs. 18% (42/232), p < 0.0001. The patients with HTG presented higher CRP 48 h after admission: 207 mg/dL ± 3 mg/dL vs. non-HTGAP 103 mg/dL ± 107 mg/dL, p < 0.0001. Among the patients with HTGAP, there were 60% (18/30) with moderately severe forms vs. 30% (71/232), p = 0.001, and 16% (5/30) SAP vs. 11% (27/232) in non-HTGAP, p = 0.4 Among the predictive markers, only haematocrit (HT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) had AUCs > 0.8. According to a multiple regression analysis, only BUN 48 h was independently associated with the development of SAP (p = 0.05). Diabetes mellitus increased the risk of developing severe acute pancreatitis (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 0.1963−9.7682; p = 0.7). In our cohort, HTGAP more frequently had local complications compared with non-HTGAP. A more severe inflammatory syndrome seemed to be associated with this aetiology; the best predictive markers for complicated forms of HTGAP were BUN 48 h and HT 48 h.",

        "Abstract": "A variety of imaging techniques exists for the diagnosis of pancreatic disorders. None of the broadly applied diagnostic methods utilizes elasticity as an indicator of tissue damage. A well-known fact is that both chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) are associated with the development of prominent fibrosis (increased tissue stiffness). To prospectively assess the accuracy of point shear wave elastography (pSWE) in differentiating between benign and malignant pancreatic diseases, establish a cut-off value for the diagnosis of PDA, and evaluate the influence of certain variables on the obtained results. The present study included 78 patients who were admitted at the Department of Gastroenterology at the university hospital \"Kaspela\" between December 2017 and August 2021 for diagnosis and/or treatment of pancreatic disorders. Based on the clinical criteria, diagnostic imaging, and histological findings, patients were divided into the CP and PDA group. The ultrasound based pSWE technique was applied and shear wave velocity (SWV) was measured. The depth of region of interest (ROI) and successful measurement rate were also recorded. The mean ± SD SWV values established through pSWE were 1.75 ± 0.34 m/s and 2.93 ± 0.91 m/s for the CP and PDA, respectively. With a cut-off value of 2.09 m/s, we calculated the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and accuracy for differentiating between CP and PDA of 89.47%, 91.20%, and 88.60%, respectively. Of the examined variables, BMI and depth of ROI in the CP group and sex in the PDA group showed a statistically significant influence on the obtained results. pSWE may be utilized as a differential diagnostic modality in patients with suspected CP or PDA.",

A brief review of the literature was performed using case reports involving Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus avium; (3) Results: Only 58 out of 658 Enteroccocus isolates were non-faecalis non-faecium and met the inclusion criteria. These species were isolated more often (p < 0.05) from the surgical ward from mixed etiology infections with E. coli. In our review, we included 39 case reports involving E. raffinosus, E. durans and E. avium; (4) Conclusions: Isolation of non-faecalis non-faecium enterococci displays an emerging trend with crucial healthcare consequences.

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic fibrosis is a complication of chronic pancreatitis and is a prominent feature of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic fibrosis is commonly observed in patients with prolonged pancreatic duct obstruction, which elevates intrapancreatic pressure. We show here that increased pancreatic duct pressure causes fibrosis and describes the mechanism by which pressure increases deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and fibrosis. We found that pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), the source of the extracellular matrix proteins in fibrosis, express the mechanically activated ion channel Piezo1. By increasing intracellular calcium, mechanical stress or the Piezo1 agonist Yoda1-activated PSCs manifest by loss of perinuclear fat droplets and increased TGF-β1, fibronectin, and type I collagen expression. These effects were blocked by the Piezo1 inhibitor GsMTx4 and absent in PSCs from mice with conditional genetic deletion of Piezo1 in stellate cells, as was pancreatic duct ligation-induced fibrosis. Although TRPV4 has been proposed to have direct mechanosensing properties, we discovered that PSCs from Trpv4-KO mice were protected against Yoda1-triggered activation. Moreover, mice devoid of TRPV4 were protected from pancreatic duct ligation-induced fibrosis. Thus, high pressure within the pancreas stimulates Piezo1 channel opening, and subsequent activation of TRPV4 leads to stellate cell activation and pressure-induced chronic pancreatitis and fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Primary postoperative ileus is one of the principal factors affecting in-hospital recovery after colorectal surgery. Research on the relationship between anaesthetic depth and perioperative outcomes has been attracting growing attention. However, the impact of anaesthetic depth on the recovery of gastrointestinal function after surgery is unclear. We aimed to conduct a single-centre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial to explore the effect of anaesthetic depth on primary postoperative ileus after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. In this single-centre, prospective, patient-blinded and assessor-blinded, parallel, randomised, controlled trial, a total of 854 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III patients, aged between 18 and 65 years and scheduled for laparoscopic colorectal surgery lasting ≥2 hours, will be randomly assigned to deep anaesthesia group (Bispectral Index (BIS) 30-40) or light anaesthesia group (BIS 45-55). The primary outcome is primary postoperative ileus during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were time to gastrointestinal function recovery, another defined postoperative ileus, 15-item quality of recovery score, length of postoperative stay, postoperative 30-day complications and serum concentrations of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein at 6 hours after surgery. The protocol was approved by Medical Ethics Committee of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University (Approval number: NFEC-2018-107) prior to recruitment. All participants will provide written informed consent before randomisation. Findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences. ChiCTR1800018725.",

The risk for developing type 2 diabetes is increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection-with the prevalence of diabetes ranging from 13% to 33%. This is likely underpinned by insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes may also be a predisposing factor for HCV infection. The new non-interferon-based therapeutic regimens for hepatitis C have transformed care and can eradicate disease. In this report, we show how such a regimen eradicated viral load, improved hepatocellular blood markers and significantly improved dysglycaemia, such that all glucose-lowering medication could be stopped.",

        "Abstract": "Since intestinal secondary bile acids (BAs) prevent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), the serum BA profile may be a convenient biomarker for CDI susceptibility in human subjects. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated blood samples from 71 patients of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the time of admission (prior to antibiotic use and CDI onset). Twelve patients developed CDI during hospitalization, and the other 59 patients did not. The serum unconjugated deoxycholic acid (DCA)/[DCA + unconjugated cholic acid (CA)] ratio on admission was significantly lower in patients who developed CDI than in patients who did not develop CDI (p < 0.01) and in 46 healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Another unconjugated secondary BA ratio, 3β-hydroxy (3βOH)-BAs/(3βOH + 3αOH-BAs), was also significantly lower in patients who developed CDI than in healthy controls (p < 0.05) but was not significantly different between patients who developed and patients who did not develop CDI. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve determined a cut-off point of DCA/(DCA + CA) < 0.349 that optimally discriminated on admission the high-risk patients who would develop CDI (sensitivity 91.7% and specificity 64.4%). In conclusion, a decreased serum DCA/(DCA + CA) ratio on admission strongly correlated with CDI onset during hospitalization in patients with gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary diseases. Serum BA composition could be a helpful biomarker for predicting susceptibility to CDI.",

Prospective observational study. University teaching hospital. One hundred and four dogs underwent various surgical procedures under general anesthesia. None. Blood pancreatic lipase activities, which were measured using FUJI DRI-CHEM v-Lip-P (FDC-v-Lip), significantly increased postoperatively compared to preoperative measurements (premedian 58.5 U/L [range, 23-157] vs. postmedian 80 U/L [range, 22-1000], P < 0.0001). The patient with a postoperative increase in FDC-v-Lip over the normal range (35 dogs [33.6%]) had significantly higher preoperative FDC-v-Lip values. In this study, dogs had significantly increased pancreas-specific lipase activities after surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Direct contributors to the increase and its relevance to clinical and histological pancreatitis should be determined in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease whose manifestations can drastically affect the individual's quality of life, and therefore adherence to treatment is important in order to keep it in remission. To verify the prevalence of non-adherence and the influence of sociodemographic, clinical and pharmacotherapeutic characteristics associated with non-adherence to treatment of UC in remission. Cross-sectional study conducted with 90 individuals diagnosed with UC in remission. The information was collected through interviews during medical consultations at Medical Clinic of Gastroenterology of Hospital Universitário da Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora. To verify the association of the variables under study with the outcome of interest and its measure of association, Student's t-test or Pearson's chi-square non-parametric test (P<0.05) was used and prevalence ratio and confidence interval were calculated. A high prevalence of non-adherence (77.8%) was found among patients with UC in remission. The individuals most likely to not adhere to the treatment were those aged less than 50 years, who were not engaged in paid work, with high scores for anxiety and who used more than one medication as part of the treatment of UC. These findings reinforce that acknowledging the factors that influence the non-adherence behavior is of paramount importance for the development of strategies by health care professionals, assuring that those will be really effective to prolong, as much as possible, one of the most successful ways to maintain the UC remission period: the use of medications.",

        "Abstract": "Gastric cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The only curative treatment options of gastric cancer are perioperative chemotherapy and surgical resection. Many nationwide registries have high validity and provide vast range of opportunities for registry-based research. Cancer diagnoses in the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR) are reported by pathology laboratories and clinician forms, while discharge diagnosis codes are reported to the Finnish Patient Registry (HILMO) automatically. Finland is known for complete registries but the completeness of gastric cancer in FCR and HILMO remains unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the registry coverage for gastric cancer in FCR and HILMO and to explore potential reasons for possible differences between these registries. Population-based nationwide retrospective cohort study. All patients diagnosed with gastric cancer in Finland during 1990 to 2014, with follow-up until 31 December 2019. Out of 21 468 total gastric cancers reported to either registry, 17 107 (79.7%) had a gastric cancer diagnosis in both registries. A substantial decrease from 88.3% to 83.4% was observed in the proportion of cases reported to FCR over time. The completeness of FCR was estimated at 87%. For HILMO, the completeness was 92.7%. Death due to gastric cancer was most common in those with gastric cancer in both registries (80.8%), and less common in those reported to only FCR (36.3%), followed by those reported to only HILMO (9.3%). The study indicates that gastric cancer is well captured by both FCR and HILMO but there is an alarming decrease in the proportion of cases captured by the FCR over time. Some gastric cancer diagnoses in HILMO might, however, be misclassified due to cancer diagnoses being assigned based on clinical suspicion.",

        "Abstract": "Gastritis is a superficial and prevalent inflammatory lesion that is considered a public health concern once can cause gastric ulcers and gastric cancer, especially when associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are the most widely used drugs to treat this illness. The aim of the study was evaluate cytogenetic effects of omeprazole in stomach epithelial cells of patients with gastritis in presence and absence of H. pylori, through cytogenetic biomarkers and catalse and superoxide dismutase analysis. The study included 152 patients from the Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic of Hospital Getúlio Vargas, Teresina-Brazil, that reported continuous and prolonged omeprazole use in doses of 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg. The participants were divided into groups: (1) patients without gastritis (n = 32); (2) patients without gastritis but with OME use (n = 24); (3) patients with gastritis (n = 26); (4) patients with gastritis undergoing OME therapy (n = 26); (5) patients with gastritis and H. pylori (n = 22) and (6) patients with gastritis and H. pylori on OME therapy (n = 22). OME induced cytogenetic imbalance in the stomach epithelium through the formation of micronuclei (group 6 > 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; group 5 > 1, 2, 3; group 4 > 1, 2, 3); bridges (groups 4 and 6 > 1, 2, 3, 5 and group 2 > 3, 5); buds (groups 2,4,6 > , 1, 3, 5); binucleated cells (group 6 > 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; group 4 > 1, 2, 3); (groups 2 and 3 > 1); picnoses (group 6 > 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), groups 2 and 5 > 1, 3; group 4 > 1, 2, 3, 5); cariorrexis (groups 6 and 4 > 1, 2, 3, 5; groups 2, 3, 5 > 1) and karyolysis (groups 2, 4, and 6 > 1, 3, 5; groups 3 and 5 > 1). The OME cytogenetic instability was associated with H. pylori infection, indicating clastogenic/aneugenic effects, chromosomes alterations, gene expression changes, cytotoxicity and apoptosis. The cytogenetic changescan be attributed to several mechanisms that are still unclear, including oxidative damage, as observed by increased catalase and superoxide dismutase expresion. Positive correlations between antioxidant enzymes were found with micronuclei formation, and were negative for picnoses. Thus, the continuous and prolonged omeprazole use induces genetic instability, which can be monitored through cytogenetic analyzes, as precursor for gastric cancer.",

Chronic cough (CC) in children is mainly attributed to persistent bacterial bronchitis, asthma, nonspecific cough, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. A multi-disciplinary approach is cost-effective and aids with earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Congenital or acquired narrowing of the subglottis is the leading ENT cause for recurrent croup (RC) in children. Laryngeal cleft-type 1 is commonly seen in children with recurrent aspiration and CC. Children are usually referred to pulmonologists for wet cough not responding to treatment. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and GERD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CC in children with both respiratory symptoms and failure to thrive.Level of Evidence: 2a.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background and study aims</b>  Colonoscopy is effective in reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer, but interval cancers remain a concern and their occurrence mainly is thought to be due to poor detection of sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) and advanced neoplasia (AN). Currently there are no low-cost, easy-to-implement tools to improve detection of difficult-to-detect polyps. Our aims were to compare the detection rate for SSLs and AN between two groups of endoscopists at a large community practice, one of which received an intervention of a polyp detection poster displayed over the monitor in their endoscopy suite for 6 months. We compared preintervention and post-intervention detection rates in the intervention and control groups. <b>Methods</b>  This was a convenience case control quality improvement project. For 6 months, a 2' × 3' poster of pictures of SSLs and advanced neoplasia was displayed over the monitor for 44 endoscopist in a large community gastroenterology practice in the Minneapolis/St.Paul area, while another 44 physicians performed colonoscopy in the usual fashion without the poster. The endpoints were improvement in detection rates for SSLs and AN preintervention and post-intervention between the control and intervention groups. <b>Results </b> During the study, 88 endoscopists performed 54,861 colonoscopies. At least one adenoma was detected in 41.3 % of patients, one or more SSLs in 11.4 %, and AN in 10.6 %. During the intervention period, the SSL detection rates were 10.9 % and 12.3 % for the control and intervention groups and for AN, the detection rates were 10.4 % and 10.75 % for the two groups, respectively. Exposure to the polyp detection poster significantly changed SSL detection for the intervention group relative to the control group (likelihood ratio test <i>P</i>  < 0.001). No significant effect of the intervention was observed for detection of AN, right-sided AN or left-sided AN, or adenoma detection rate. <b>Conclusions </b> Placement of a polyp detection poster above the endoscopy video monitor increased detection of SSL but not AN.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background and study aims </b> According to a recent guideline, patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) should have at least five biopsies performed under the Sydney protocol to evaluate for risk of extensive GIM. However, only narrow-band imaging (NBI)-targeted biopsy may be adequate to diagnose extensive GIM. <b>Patients and methods</b>  A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2019 and October 2020. Patients with histology-proven GIM were enrolled. All patients underwent standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed by a gastroenterology trainee. The performing endoscopists took biopsies from either a suspected GIM area (NBI-targeted biopsy) or randomly (if negative for GIM read by NBI) to complete five areas of the stomach as per the Sydney protocol. The gold standard for GIM diagnosis was pathology read by two gastrointestinal pathologists with unanimous agreement. <b>Results</b>  A total of 95 patients with GIM were enrolled and 50 (52.6%) were men with a mean age of 64 years. Extensive GIM was diagnosed in 43 patients (45.3%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of NBI-targeted biopsy vs. the Sydney protocol were 88.4% vs.100 %, 90.3% vs. 90.3%, 88.4% vs. 89.6%, 90.3% vs. 100%, and 89.5% vs. 94.7%, respectively. The number of specimens from NBI-targeted biopsy was significantly lower than that from Sydney protocol (311vs.475, <i>P</i>  < 0.001). <b>Conclusions</b>  Both NBI-targeted biopsy and Sydney protocol by a gastroenterologist who was not an expert in NBI and who has experience with diagnosis of at least 60 cases of GIM provided an NPV higher than 90%. Thus, targeted biopsy alone with NBI, which requires fewer specimens, is an alternative option for extensive GIM diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and extra-intestinal manifestations are common. Although common features of CD include fistulation and abscess formation, they typically manifest exclusively in the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract and in patients who do not have adequate control over their disease. Pyogenic liver abscess is rare in the general population and is an unusual and extra-intestinal manifestation of CD. Herein, we present a patient with Crohn's ileo-colitis who presented with generalized abdominal pain and fevers and was found to have multiple pyogenic liver abscesses biopsy-proven to be secondary to CD. The patient's liver abscesses were refractory to repeated CT-guided drainage and antibiotic therapy. This paper illustrates a rare condition in the general population and those with CD. We intend to discuss the differences of pyogenic liver abscesses in CD compared to the general population, the rarity of this presentation and propose a unique mechanism by which the patient may have developed this liver abscess. It is common for clinicians to mistake the diagnosis of febrile illness with or without abdominal pain as a simple reactivation of CD, and thus it is important to keep pyogenic liver abscess on the differential even if their disease state is otherwise well controlled.",

This has the obvious drawback of being invasive as well as carrying a small risk. The most widely used non-invasive approaches include the use of faecal calprotectin in the case of IBD and fecal immunochemical test in the case of CRC. However, the necessity of stool collection limits their acceptability for some patients. Over the recent years, there has been emerging data looking at the role of non-invasively obtained colorectal mucus as a screening and diagnostic tool in IBD and CRC. It has been shown that the mucus rich material obtained by self-sampling of anal surface following defecation, can be used to measure various biomarkers that can aid in diagnosis of these conditions.",

We included 270 patients who referred for ERCP between March 2017 and March 2018. They were enrolled into MS (2 g) and placebo (normal saline) groups, administered 1 hour before and 6 hours after the procedure. The ERCPs were done by fellows of gastroenterology under supervision of expert physicians. The incidence and severity of PEP were followed. PEP was seen in 12 (8.9%) patients in the MS group and 17 (12.6%) in the placebo group (<i>P</i> value=0.33). The incidence of PEP in high risk patients group (<i>P</i> value=0.017). Although the usage of MS was not able to prevent PEP in all patients enrolled in this study, but it could significantly reduce the incidence of PEP in high risk patients of intervention group in comparison with placebo group. The median length of hospital stay was also significantly lower in new drug group in contrast to placebo.",

        "Abstract": "This study was aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of external hernia among adult patients visiting the surgical outpatient department (OPD) at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialised Hospital (UOGCSH), Northwest Ethiopia. Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 5 April 2020 to 22 June 2020. UOGCSH. All adult patients above 18 years of age who visited the surgical OPD at the UOGCSH. Prevalence of external hernia. A total of 403 study participants were involved in this study with a response rate of 100%. The prevalence of external hernia was 11.7% (95% CI 8.8% to 15.1%). The epigastric hernia had the highest prevalence 16 (34%), followed by inguinal hernia 14 (29.8%). Old age (adjusted OR (AOR) =2.47, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.78), constipation (AOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.68 to 8.11), chronic cough (AOR 5.18, 95% CI 2.17 to 12.3) and lifting of heavy objects (AOR 7.39, 95% CI 3.36 to 16.2) had a statistically significant association with external hernia. Regardless of hardly any significant gender difference, the overall prevalence of external hernia was high. Old age, constipation, chronic cough and lifting of heavy objects were found to have a significant association with an external hernia. Patients who have constipation and cough should get appropriate treatment early.",

        "Title": "SMAD4 TGF-β-independent function preconditions naive CD8+ T cells to prevent severe chronic intestinal inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "SMAD4, a mediator of TGF-β signaling, plays an important role in T cells to prevent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the precise mechanisms underlying this control remain elusive. Using both genetic and epigenetic approaches, we revealed an unexpected mechanism by which SMAD4 prevents naive CD8+ T cells from becoming pathogenic for the gut. Prior to the engagement of the TGF-β receptor, SMAD4 restrains the epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional landscape of the TGF-β signature in naive CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, prior to TGF-β signaling, SMAD4 binds to promoters and enhancers of several TGF-β target genes, and by regulating histone deacetylation, suppresses their expression. Consequently, regardless of a TGF-β signal, SMAD4 limits the expression of TGF-β negative feedback loop genes, such as Smad7 and Ski, and likely conditions CD8+ T cells for the immunoregulatory effects of TGF-β. In addition, SMAD4 ablation conferred naive CD8+ T cells with both a superior survival capacity, by enhancing their response to IL-7, as well as an enhanced capacity to be retained within the intestinal epithelium, by promoting the expression of Itgae, which encodes the integrin CD103. Accumulation, epithelial retention, and escape from TGF-β control elicited chronic microbiota-driven CD8+ T cell activation in the gut. Hence, in a TGF-β-independent manner, SMAD4 imprints a program that preconditions naive CD8+ T cell fate, preventing IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation is a known complication of intense immunosuppression with B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody therapy and transplantation immunosuppression. HBV reactivation has occurred following treatment with chemotherapy regimens for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. There are 2 prior case reports of HBV reactivation following cisplatin monotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here, we present a case of a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There are no consensus guidelines on how to define hepatitis B reactivation. There are guidelines on when to initiate prophylaxis with Entecavir while on immunosuppressive therapy with risk according to medication category and hepatitis B surface antigen/hepatitis B core antibody IgG serology. CDC recommends screening everyone. American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) now with a recent update in 2020 recommends screening everyone. There is a definite role of immunosuppression in HBV reactivation, however, there is also direct enhancement by cisplatin of viral replication by creating endoplasmic reticulum stress which increases HBV DNA indirectly. Finally, cytotoxicity enhances HBV reactivation and immune reconstitution post withdrawing immunosuppressive treatment. Because of the effects of chemotherapy, aka cisplatin goes beyond immunosuppression-related reactivation of HBV, our recommendations are in line with CDC and ASCO to screen all patients for HBV before onset of chemotherapy and start Entecavir/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate before the onset of chemotherapy for HBV-positive patients.",

        "Abstract": "A large proportion of patients with visual impairment secondary to non-infectious uveitis may require DMARDs. Although these are highly effective, some patients may require alternatives to the currently available immunomodulators due to an inadequate response or undesirable side effects. Janus Kinase Inhibitors (JAKi) are already approved for several autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology. To date, JAKi have been studied in phase 3 trials in various types of uveitis. Mechanism of Action: JAKi work by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Janus kinases, which are transmembrane proteins. This blocks the activation of transcription factors, which in turn downregulates cytokine expression and inflammatory mediators. JAKi represent an extremely effective novel therapeutic approach in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology. They have already been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic eczema. In earlier comparative studies with conventional biologics, a better therapeutic response was reported in some cases. Several published case reports report reduced cortisone levels in patients with uveitis who had responded poorly to conventional and biological DMARDs. Approval studies are under way for JIA-associated and ANA-positive anterior uveitis. In summary, JAKi represent an innovative treatment option for patients with non-infectious uveitis in whom DMARDs are contraindicated or ineffective.",

Forty-four (males <i>n=</i>26 and females <i>n=</i>18) endurance trained (<i>V̇ O</i> <sub>2max</sub> 56.8min/kg/min) participants completed either: P1-2h high intensity interval running in 23°C ambient temperature (T<sub>amb</sub>), P2-2h running at 60% V̇ O<sub>2max</sub> in 35°C T<sub>amb</sub>, or P3-3h running at 60% V̇ O<sub>2max</sub> in 23°C T<sub>amb</sub>. Blood samples were collected pre- and post-exercise to determine plasma IgM, IgA, and IgG concentrations. Overall resting pre-exercise levels for plasma Ig were 173MMU/ml, 37AMU/ml, and 79GMU/ml, respectively. Plasma IgM concentration did not substantially change pre- to post-exercise in all protocols, and the magnitude of pre- to post-exercise change for IgM was not different between protocols (p=0.135). Plasma IgA and IgG increased pre- to post-exercise in P2 only (p=0.017 and p=0.016, respectively), but remained within normative range (35-250MU/ml). P2 resulted in greater disturbances to plasma IgA (p=0.058) and IgG (p=0.037), compared with P1 and P3. No substantial differences in pre-exercise and exercise-associated change was observed for EndoCAb between biological sexes. Exertional and exertional-heat stress resulted in modest disturbances to systemic EndoCAb responses, suggesting EndoCAb biomarkers presents a low sensitivity response to controlled-laboratory experimental designs within exercise gastroenterology.",

        "Abstract": "Background Anorectal malformations are congenital defects wherein there is defective development of the anus and rectum. For babies born with congenital anorectal malformations, prompt treatment is crucial which requires detection of the anomalies at the earliest. This study aimed to determine the epidemiology ofanorectal malformations in the Pediatric Unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan over a period of 19 months. Methodology An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted retrospectively from January 2020 to September 2021 using a non-randomized consecutive sampling technique. Patients aged less than eight years were included, whereas burnt, torn, and incomplete records from the Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) were excluded. SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data entry and analysis. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression were applied for analyzing the association between explanatory and dependent variables. Results Of the 1,108 patients, 72 (6.5%) patients had anorectal malformations. Gastrointestinal diseases made up about 64.3% of all diseases. Among gastrointestinal causes, the prevalence of anorectal malformation was up to 10.1%. The mortality of anorectal malformation patients was low (2.85%) compared to mortalities due to other gastrointestinal abnormalities (8.25%). Anorectal malformation had significantly lower odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 0.19, p < 0.05) compared to other gastrointestinal abnormalities. Conclusions This study has provided data about the prevalence of anorectal malformation and its mortality which were calculated as 6.5% and 2.58%, respectively. Female gender, neonates, and delayed presentation were seen to have higher mortality, highlighting the need to screen all neonates pre- and post-natally to avoid any misdiagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "To analyze the time trends in cardia cancer detection rates using endoscopic surveillance from 1999 to 2019 in a high-volume Chinese hospital. In this retrospective, single-center study, data were collected from the Endoscopy Center of the Department of Gastroenterology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, from 1999 to 2019. Cases of cardia cancer (<i>n</i> = 1567) were extracted from a database of patients who underwent endoscopy. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with cardia cancer were analyzed, including sex, age, and proportion of early gastric cancer and degree of tumor differentiation. The joinpoint regression method was used to identify change points in incidence trends. Annual percent change (APC) values, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were calculated for time periods before and after change points. Of the 343942 patients who underwent endoscopy during 1999-2009, 1567 (4.6%) were identified with cardia cancer. The overall cardia adenocarcinoma detection rate decreased significantly from 1999 to 2004 (APC = -37.3, 95% CI: -20.9, -6.4), followed by a relatively slower decline rate from 2004 to 2019 (APC = -7.7, 95% CI: -4.4, -7.6). The crude rate of detection of early cardia cancer could not be determined by joinpoint analysis. Rates of detection reduced significantly in patients aged 60-69 and 70-79 years (APC = -8.3, 95% CI: -9.8, -6.8 and APC = -7.3, 95% CI: -8.8, -5.8, respectively). The detection rate in males decreased rapidly from 1999 to 2004 (APC = -35.9, 95% CI: -18.2, 5.6, <i>P</i> < 0.05), while the decline rate was relatively slow from 2005 to 2019 (APC = -6.9, 95% CI: -3.4, -6.1, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Among females, the detection rates also decreased from 1999 to 2004 (APC = -21.2, 95% CI: -28.1, -13.7), but remained stable from 2007 to 2019 (APC = -3.8, 95% CI: -7.9, -0.5). Detection of poorly differentiated cardia cancer also declined from 2009 to 2019 (APC = -12.8, 95% CI: -15.3, -10.0). The detection rate of cardia cancer among gastric cancers has been stable from 2008 to 2019. The trend of detection rate of early cardia cancer showed no significant statistical meaning; hence, it remains necessary to carefully observe the cardia area during endoscopy examination.",

Symptoms include abdominal bloating, low back pain, and dyspareunia. CPP is considered a symptom and not a diagnosis. The etiology may involve a specific organ or condition (eg, endometriosis, adhesions). The most common associated conditions are endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression. The history and physical examination are essential in the evaluation. A comprehensive history that encompasses the gynecologic, obstetric, surgical, and psychosocial histories is key. The psychosocial history should include screening for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and physical and sexual abuse because of their association with CPP. The physical examination should include musculoskeletal, abdominal, and gynecologic examinations. The choice of laboratory tests and imaging studies should be guided by the history and physical examination findings. Management is multimodal and involves management of associated conditions, pharmacotherapy, surgeries and procedures, physical therapy, and behavior and lifestyle therapies. The multidisciplinary care team typically consists of the primary care physician, subspecialty physicians (eg, gynecology, pain management, psychiatry, gastroenterology, urology), a physical therapist, and a behavioral health subspecialist.",

        "Abstract": "The early recognition of malnutrition is essential for improving the prognosis of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria represent a new consensus for the diagnosis of malnutrition but need to be validated in CD. The aims were to explore the related factors of malnutrition in CD and explore whether GLIM-positive patients who did not meet the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) would benefit from nutritional treatment. This study retrospectively enrolled patients with CD at the Gastroenterology Department of Xiangya Hospital Central South University between March 2020 and March 2021. After bioelectrical impedance analysis, all patients underwent nutritional screening and diagnosis using the NRS 2002 and GLIM criteria, respectively. Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate risk factors related to malnutrition in patients with CD. A multivariable Cox hazard model was used to assess the association between nutritional therapy and prognostic outcomes. Of the 118 patients included, fifty were classified as having a high malnutrition risk according to the NRS 2002, while 76 were diagnosed with malnutrition by the GLIM criteria. Multivariate analysis showed that a high malnutrition risk was independently associated with the L4 phenotype [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 4.718 (1.108, 20.10), <i>p</i> = 0.036] and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) [OR (95% CI) = 1.018 (1.007, 1.029), <i>p</i> = 0.002] based on the NRS 2002. The age at onset [OR (95% CI) = 0.828 (0.699, 0.980), <i>p</i> = 0.028] and CDAI [OR (95% CI) = 1.111 (1.034, 1.195), <i>p</i> = 0.004] were regarded as independent risk factors related to malnutrition, as determined by the GLIM criteria. Among 26 GLIM+/NRS- patients, significantly more patients who received nutritional support achieved 6-week remission than patients who did not (100 vs. 71.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The 6-week remission risk in patients treated with nutrition therapy was more than 4-fold higher than those without nutritional therapy. The GLIM criteria could diagnose more malnourished patients with CD who are not positively screened by the NRS 2002, among whom nutritional support therapy would be beneficial for disease remission. The new criteria should be more appropriate for assessing the nutritional status of patients with CD.",

Specifically, we aimed to investigate whether the proportion of FIT-negative CRC missed by a single FIT test in symptomatic patients could be reduced by duplicate FIT testing. A retrospective service evaluation cohort study of the diagnostic accuracy of duplicate FIT testing. Patients referred from primary care with suspected CRC to four secondary care trusts in North-West England. 28 622 patients over 18-years-old with lower gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of CRC who completed two FIT samples. The performance of duplicate FIT for detecting CRC at a threshold of 10 µgHb/g. The sensitivity if either test was >10 µgHb/g was 0.978 (0.955-0.989), specificity was 0.662 (0.657-0.668), positive predictive value 0.031 (0.028-0.035) and negative predictive value 1.00 (0.999-1.00). Despite two-thirds of patients (18952) being negative following two tests, at this threshold only seven CRC were missed over a 26-month period. All seven patients had other high-risk features which should have prompted investigation. This study suggests that in routine NHS practice, a duplicate FIT sample strategy together with clinical evaluation for evidence of anaemia and weight loss is superior to a single FIT sample alone and would allow symptomatic patients to be managed in primary care without the need for urgent referral to secondary care for urgent colonic imaging.",

        "Abstract": "Chilaiditi sign is a rare incidental radiographic finding where bowel is interposed between the diaphragm and the liver, often seen as air under the right hemidiaphragm. A majority of patients with Chilaiditi sign are asymptomatic and remain so throughout their lifetime. Chilaiditi sign is recategorized as Chilaiditi syndrome if it becomes symptomatic and is a very rare etiology of bowel obstruction. As bowel obstruction confers a huge financial burden to the health care system, studies of even the rarer etiologies are of significant value. Particularly in the case of Chilaiditi syndrome, the free air under the right hemidiaphragm can lead physicians to prematurely conclude pneumoperitoneum, which would require an emergent surgical evaluation. It is through the incorporation of a broad differential and clinical presentation that physicians can decrease the inappropriate allocation of hospital resources and unnecessary surgical procedures; additionally, keeping Chilaiditi syndrome on the differential may prevent unnecessary surgical intervention, cost to the patient, and downstream complications. Bowel obstruction secondary to Chilaiditi syndrome is most commonly treated with conservative management including intravenous fluids, bowel rest, decompression, and laxatives. If the symptoms worsen and progress to full bowel obstruction, surgical intervention has shown great efficacy. We report a case of a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency department for progressively worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting incidentally found to have colonic interposition with mild colonic dilatation on computed tomography (CT) imaging. The patient was diagnosed with bowel obstruction secondary to Chilaiditi syndrome and treated non-surgically with rapid recovery.",

Survival between groups was compared using the traditional Kaplan-Meier method and the cumulative incidence function (CIF) method. Propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was conducted to balance the differences in vital variables between groups. The HR and 95% CI for ECC relative to ICC were used to quantify the risk of death. Subgroup analysis was further used to evaluate the stability of the differences between groups. The study included 876 patients with ECC and 1194 patients with ICC. Before PSM, with the Kaplan-Meier method, postoperative overall survival and cancer-specific death for ECC were worse than those for ICC. However, with the CIF method, no difference in postoperative cancer-specific death was found. After PSM, all differences in the considered traits were balanced, and 173 pairs of patients were retained. Survival analysis found that there was no difference in postoperative all-cause death (Kaplan-Meier method, p=0.186) or cancer-specific death (Kaplan-Meier and CIF methods, p=0.500 and p=0.913, respectively), which was consistent with subgroup analysis. ECC and ICC showed no difference in postoperative cancer-specific death, both in the natural state and in multiple variable-matched conditions. researchregistry4175.",

        "Abstract": "It has been documented that Crohn's disease (CD) patients were prone to develop non-alcoholic liver fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with less metabolic factors. Our purpose is to investigate the prevalence, clinical characteristics and possible indicators for NAFLD in a cohort of Chinese patients with CD. Established CD patients who underwent magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) at the gastroenterology unit of our hospital were consecutively enrolled between June 2018 and May 2020. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made by magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction (MR-PDFF) maps. Medical records during hospitalization were collected and examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Then a predictive model was constructed based on logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk of developing NAFLD. A total of 340 CD subjects were enrolled in this study, 83 (24.4%) suffered from NAFLD. Compared with those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD showed longer disease duration, higher body mass index (BMI), more frequent use of corticosteroid and pronouncedly elevated liver function tests. The comparison showed no difference in terms of prolonged anti tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) use (> 54w). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI, serum transaminase, pre-albumin and disease duration could independently predict hepatic steatosis. NAFLD is frequent in chronic CD patients, while long term use of anti TNF-α seems to have no impact on the development of NAFLD in this population. The model incorporating duration, serum transaminase and body mass index presented as a clinical nomogram could well predict the risk of NAFLD in patient with CD.",

        "Abstract": "Guidelines on quality of upper GI (UGI) endoscopy have been proposed by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). However, these guidelines have not been evaluated in clinical practice. We aimed to measure the impact of endoscopist education on the quality of gastroscopy based on these guidelines and the association between compliance with guidelines and the detection of clinically significant premalignant pathology such as Barrett's esophagus (BE), esophageal squamous dysplasia, gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), and Helicobacter pylori. Endoscopists participated in a 1-hour education session on recommended performance measures and endoscopic detection of premalignant pathologies. A controlled before and after study was performed, measuring compliance with guidelines and rates of detection of pathology in control and intervention groups. Over 2 years, 2719 procedures were performed: 1412 in the control group and 1307 in the intervention group. The proportion of procedures complying with guidelines was higher in the intervention group. The use of biopsy sampling protocols (eg, management of precancerous conditions of the stomach, 52% vs 91%; P = .007) and standardized terminology (eg, Forrest classification, 24% vs 68%; P < .001) was significantly higher. Detection of H pylori was higher in the intervention group (5.5% vs 9.8%, P = .003). Minimum inspection time of 7 minutes was associated with detection of BE (7.4% vs 2.0%, P < .001). A simple endoscopist education session enhanced the quality of UGI endoscopy by improving compliance with BSG and ESGE recommendations and increasing the detection of clinically significant pathology. A minimum inspection time of 7 minutes was associated with increased diagnostic yield and may be a feasible quality indicator for clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is one of the most common pathogenic bacterium worldwide, infecting about 50% of the world's population. It is a major cause of several upper gastrointestinal diseases, including peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. The emergence of <i>H. pylori</i> resistance to antibiotics has been a major clinical challenge in the field of gastroenterology. In the course of <i>H. pylori</i> infection, some bacteria invade the gastric epithelium and are encapsulated into a self-produced matrix to form biofilms that protect the bacteria from external threats. Bacteria with biofilm structures can be up to 1000 times more resistant to antibiotics than planktonic bacteria. This implies that targeting biofilms might be an effective strategy to alleviate <i>H. pylori</i> drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to develop drugs that can eliminate or disperse biofilms. In recent years, anti-biofilm agents have been investigated as alternative or complementary therapies to antibiotics to reduce the rate of drug resistance. This article discusses the formation of <i>H. pylori</i> biofilms, the relationship between biofilms and drug resistance in <i>H. pylori</i>, and the recent developments in the research of anti-biofilm agents targeting <i>H. pylori</i> drug resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Poor food intake is a major etiological factor of malnutrition. This research aims to describe the prevalence of recent and current low food intake (LI<sub>RC</sub>) and to identify factors associated with LI<sub>RC</sub> in adult hospital patients from different medical specialities. 1865 patients participating in the nutritionDay survey 2016-2020 in Germany were included. LI<sub>RC</sub> was defined by decreased eating both on nutritionDay and in the week before hospitalisation. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with LI<sub>RC</sub> overall and in different specialities. LI<sub>RC</sub> was observed in 21.1% of all patients, with the highest prevalence in Gastroenterology (26.6%) and the lowest in Neurology (11.2%). Weight loss within three months before nutritionDay (OR 2.62 [95% CI 1.93-3.56]), (very) poor self-rated health (2.17 [1.62-2.91]), female sex (1.98 [1.50-2.61]), uncertain weight loss (1.90 [1.03-3.51]), digestive disease (1.90 [1.40-2.56]), inability to walk without assistance (1.55 [1.14-2.12]) and emergency admission (1.38 [1.02-1.86]) were associated with increased risk, cardiac insufficiency (0.55 [0.37-0.83]) and being in a neurological ward (0.51 [0.28-0.92]) with decreased risk in the total sample. In Gastroenterology and Oncology, estimates were higher than in the entire sample; no significant associations were found in Neurology and Geriatrics, presumably due to the low prevalence of LI<sub>RC</sub> in Neurology and limited data quality in Geriatrics. LI<sub>RC</sub> is common in German hospital patients and associated with female sex, poor health and decreased functional status. Interdisciplinary differences suggest a discipline-specific approach to dealing with malnutrition.",

        "Abstract": "Differentiating between benign and malignant biliary stenosis (BS) is challenging, where tissue diagnosis plays a crucial role. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-based tissue sampling and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or biopsy (FNB) are used to obtain tissue specimens from BS. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA/B plus ERCP with brushing or forceps biopsy in BS. All endoscopic procedures performed in patients with BS at our gastroenterology unit were reviewed. The gold standard for diagnosis was histopathology of surgical specimens or the progression of the malignancy at radiological or clinical follow-up. A total of 70 endoscopic procedures were performed in 51 patients with BS. Final endoscopic diagnosis was reached in 96% of the patients and was malignant in 61.7% and benign in 38.3% of cases. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 73.9%, 100%, and 80%, respectively, for EUS-FNA/B; 66.7%, 100%, and 82.5% for ERCP; and 83.3%, 100%, and 87.5% for both procedures carried out in the same session. The combination of EUS and ERCP tissue sampling seems to increase diagnostic accuracy in defining the etiology of BS. Performing both procedures in a single session reduces the time required for diagnostic work-up and optimizes resources.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Refeeding syndrome (RS) is a neglected, potentially fatal syndrome that occurs in malnourished patients undergoing rapid nutritional replenishment after a period of fasting. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) recently released new criteria for RS risk and diagnosis. Real-life data on its incidence are still limited. Methods: We consecutively enrolled patients admitted to the Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology Unit of our center. The RS risk prevalence and incidence of RS were evaluated according to ASPEN. The length of stay (LOS), mortality, and re-admission rate within 30 days were assessed. Results: Among 203 admitted patients, 98 (48.3%) were at risk of RS; RS occurred in 38 patients (18.7% of the entire cohort). Patients diagnosed with RS had a higher mean LOS (12.5 days ± 7.9) than those who were not diagnosed with RS (7.1 ± 4.2) (p < 0.0001). Nine patients (4.4%) died. Body mass index (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69−0.97), RS diagnosis (OR 10.1; 95% CI 2.4−42.6), and medical nutritional support within 48 h (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.02−0.56) were associated with mortality. Conclusions: RS incidence is high among clinical wards, influencing clinical outcomes. Awareness among clinicians is necessary to identify patients at risk and to support those developing this syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Nurses record data in electronic health records (EHRs) using different terminologies and coding systems. The purpose of this study was to identify unstructured free-text nursing activities recorded by nurses in EHRs with natural language processing (NLP) techniques and to map these nursing activities into standard nursing activities using the SMASH method. A retrospective study using NLP techniques with a unidirectional mapping strategy called SMASH. The unstructured free-text nursing activities recorded in the Medicine, Neurology and Gastroenterology inpatient units of the Agostino Gemelli IRCCS University Hospital Foundation, Rome, Italy were collected for 6 months in 2018. Data were analyzed by three phases: a) text summarization component with NLP techniques, b) a consensus analysis by four experts to detect the category of word stems, and c) cross-mapping with SMASH. The SMASH method calculated the string comparison, similarity and distance of words through the Levenshtein distance (LD), Jaro-Winker distance and the cross-mapping's cut-offs: map [0.80-1.00] with &lt; 13 LD, partial-map [0.50-0.79] with &lt;13 LD and no map [0.0-0.49] with &gt;13 LD. During the study period, 491 patient records were assessed. 548 different unstructured free-text nursing activities were recorded by nurses. 451 unstructured free-text nursing activities (82.3%) were mapped to standard PAI nursing activities, 47 (8.7%) were partial mapped, while 50 (9.0%) were not mapped. This automated mapping yielded recall of 0.95%, precision of 0.94%, accuracy of 0.91%, F-measure of 0.96. The F-measure indicates good reliability of this automated procedure in cross-mapping. Lexical similarities between unstructured free-text nursing activities and standard nursing activities were found, NLP with the SMASH method is a feasible approach to extract data related to nursing concepts that are not recorded through structured data entry.",

        "Abstract": "The study group of the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology released evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for chronic constipation (CC) in 2017, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was treated as one of the causes of CC. We examined the differences in characteristics between IBS and non-IBS subjects with CC who underwent a medical check-up in Japan. A total of 10,658 subjects participated in this study, and we focused on 467 subjects who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of CC using a questionnaire survey. The number of IBS subjects was 21, and they had sleep disorders, were more symptomatic (e.g., abdominal pain, abdominal bloating/distension, feeling stressed, annoyance, lack of motivation, fatigue upon waking, and feeling depressed), and had more episodes of sensation of incomplete evacuation and anorectal obstruction/blockage during defecation than non-IBS subjects. Furthermore, stool frequency of IBS subjects was significantly different from non-IBS subjects. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors associated with a higher stool frequency were IBS [odds ratio (OR), 2.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-6.05; <i>p</i> = 0.049], male sex (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.20-3.23; <i>p</i> = 0.007), and regular exercise (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05-3.07; <i>p</i> = 0.033).
